gardening, doityourself,
physical exercise and housework. The
original description of the EPIC questions suggested calculation
of reported energy expenditure in all of the activities in question
2 by multiplying reported time by standard energy costs
from published compendia [11]. The third question asks whether
any of the activities in question 2 were engaged in such that
it caused sweating or faster heartbeat and, if so, for how many
hours during a typical week. The fourth question asks about stair
climbing. ",category,"A simple physical activity index was devised to allocate
individuals to four categories of usual physical activity: inactive,

(Polar Electro, Finland) continuously during the waking hours of
the following four days. The energy expenditure data weresummed
over the day to create an estimate of daytime energy expenditure. After adjustment for age and sex, the selfreported
physical
activity index was positively correlated with mean daytime
energy expenditure (r = 0.28, p < 0.001). The unadjusted (r = 0.44,

reported algorithm, which takes into account age, sex, total cholesterol,
HDLC,
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking and
the presence of diabetes [1]. Participants were categorized into
three groups according to their calculated 10year
Framingham
risk score: low (?10%), intermediate (11–20%) and high (>20%)
risk. Within each Framingham risk score category, Cox regression
was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) for the risk of future CHD. HRs were
obtained for each category of physical activity, using the active
group as a reference category. To assess whether physical activity
had predictive value on top of the Framingham risk score, we calculated
HRs for future CHD within in each FRS category. Finally, we
quantified whether using physical activity in addition to the Framingham
risk score, resulted in reclassification of people into other
risk categories, which would have therapeutic consequences for
those individuals. We regressed FRS on CHD risk, yielding a probability
of CHD risk for ach individual. Probabilities equivalent to
FRS = 10% and FRS = 20% were identified and used to divide people
into low, intermediate and high risk. Next, we regressed FRS
and physical activity on CHD risk, and we used the same probabilities
to divide people into low, intermediate and high risk. Based
on these divisions, we constructed a 3×3 table for people who did
and did not perform CHD during followup.

Approval for this study was obtained from the ethical review boards of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and from all local recruiting institutions.

For the present analysis, we excluded a priori the following women: 19,953 with prevalent cancer at enrolment, 1,293 with missing follow-up data, 35,444 with a hysterectomy at baseline, 6,091 participants who were in the top or bottom 1% of the distri- bution of the ratio of energy intake to estimated energy require- ment32 and 3,586 members with no dietary or lifestyle data.

Data on vital status in most EPIC study centres were collected from mortality registries at the re- gional or national level, in combination with data collected by active follow-up (Greece). Vital status was known for 98.4% of all EPIC participants as at April 2004. Women were followed from the date of enrolment until endometrial cancer diagnosis, death, emigration or end of the follow-up period. The closure date for this study period for each EPIC centre was the date of the last complete follow-up for both cancer incidence and vital status, which varied between December 1999 and March 2004 between EPIC centres. A total of 689 incident cases of endometrial cancer were diagnosed during the follow-up period. The cancer diagnosis was confirmed by histology for 88% of cases, by clinical examina- tion for 9% and the remaining 3% by either self-report, tomogra- phy scan, surgery, autopsy or by death certificate. Detailed mor- phology was specified for 226 (33%) cases, of which 207 (92%) were endometrioid, 8 (4%) serous, 5 (2%) mucinous, 4 (2%) clear cell and 2 (1%) undifferentiated.44",,"The assessment of physical activity has been previously described in detail.33 The EPIC physical activity questionnaire was derived from a longer, modified version of the Baecke ques- tionnaire,34 and was administered at study entry predominantly by self-administration.30,33 The stratification by study centre in this and other EPIC-analyses is considered to control for center effects related to different questionnaire design and follow-up procedures. In a study by Pols et al.,35 the Spearman correlation coefficients for the estimated reproducibility of the EPIC questionnaire over 5–11 months ranged from 0.49 to 0.81 in women, and for the rela- tive validity as assessed by 3-day activity diaries the correlation coefficients ranged from 0.28 to 0.72. They found the question- naire to be satisfactory for the ranking of subjects although less suitable for the estimation of energy expenditure.
Data on current occupational activity included employment sta- tus and the level of physical activity done at work (nonworker, sedentary, standing, manual, heavy manual and unknown). Partici- pants were also asked to report the frequency and duration of rec- reational and household activities, in summer and winter, during a typical week in the past year. Household activities included house- work, home repair, gardening and stair climbing. Recreational activities included walking, cycling and sports activities. The overall level of recreational and household activity was calculated in MET-hours/week, by summing the metabolic equivalent inten- sity values (METs)36 that were assigned to reported hours per week of recreational and household activities. The assigned MET values were 3.0 for walking, 6.0 for cycling, 4.0 for gardening, 6.0 for sports, 4.5 for home repair (do-it-yourself work), 3.0 for house- work and 8.0 for stair climbing, obtained by estimating the aver- age of all comparable activities in the compendium of physical activities.36 In addition, the frequency and duration of vigorous nonoccupational activity, defined as activities causing sweating or faster heartbeat, was collected.",MET-hours/week,Quartiles of MET-hours/week) ,Occupational activity; Household activity; Total physical activity,689,hr,"Stratified by age and centre, and adjusted for BMI, age at menarche, menopausal status, age at menopause, age at birth of last child, ever use of oral contraceptives, ever use of hormone replacement therapy, education, smoking status, hypertension, dia- betes, fruit and vegetable intake, fibre intake, carbohydrate intake, energy intake.",Stratified by age and centre,,Quartiles of MET-hours/week) ,192,438560.0,66362,1,,,,,,,,,"Totals exclude 18 cases and 6,439 noncases where the occu- pational activity is unknown.

Approval for this study was obtained from the ethical review boards of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and from all local recruiting institutions.

Data on current occupa- tional activity included employment status and the level of physical activity done at work (nonworker, sedentary, stand- ing, manual, heavy manual and unknown). Housewives were categorized as nonworkers. In the Danish centers, the ques- tionnaire focused on type of work activity done within the last year, and participants who did not answer this question were categorized as nonworking.
The number of hours per week of nonoccupational physi- cal activities during the past year were collected in all centers and was comprised household activities, including house- work, home repair (do-it-yourself activities), gardening and stair climbing, and recreational activities including walking, cycling and sports combined as done in winter and summer separately. Since the intensity of recreational and household activities was not directly recorded, a metabolic equivalent (MET) value was assigned to each reported activity according to the Compendium of Physical Activities.31 A MET is defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to a standard metabolic rate of 1.0 kcal (4.184 kJ)/kg/hr, one MET is considered a resting metabolic rate obtained during quiet sitting. The MET values assigned to the nonoccupational data were: 3.0 for walking, 6.0 for cycling, 4.0 for gardening, 6.0 for sports, 4.5 for home repair (do-it-yourself work), 3.0 for housework and 8.0 for stair climbing. These mean MET values were obtained by estimating the average of all comparable activ- ities in the Compendium. The mean number of hours per week of summer and winter household and recreational activities were estimated and then multiplied by the appropri- ate MET values to obtain MET-hours/week of activity.
Housework (including child and older adult care), home repair, gardening, and stair climbing were combined to obtain an overall estimate of household activity. Walking (including walking to work, shopping and leisure time), cycling (including cycling to work, shopping and leisure time) and sports activities were combined to derive overall recreational physical activity. Household and recreational activities in MET-hours/week were combined and cohort par- ticipants classified according to EPIC-wide quartiles of total nonoccupational physical activity.
Two indices of total physical activity, combining occupa- tional and non-occupational activities, have been developed pre- viously. Both indices categorize individuals into inactive, moder- ately inactive, moderately active and active groups. The ‘‘Cambridge index’’ cross-classifies occupational activity with hours spent doing cycling and sports.30,32 The second index, the ‘‘total physical activity index’’, cross-classifies all household and recreational activity combined with occupational activity.29,3",,Cambridge Index - Wareham,"Recreational activity, Occupational activity, Household activity, Combined recreational and household activities, Cambridge physical activity index",8034,hr,"Stratified by age and center and adjusted for body mass index, age at first period, age at first full term pregnancy, number of full term pregnancies, breast feeding, ever OC pill, menopausal status, age at menopause, use of hormone replacement therapy, alcohol consumption, smoking status, level of school attained; mutually adjusted for other types of physical activity if applicable, 2p for trend based on the mean value within each quartile category.",,,Active,1323,237803.0,22034,0.94,0.87,1.01,,,,,,,Results by age at diagnosis.

The CCR is a population- based cancer registry established by state legislation mandating cancer reporting; the CCR is estimated to be over 99% complete (Kwong et al, 2001). The high standards maintained by the CCR ensure that follow-up for cancer outcomes are virtually complete as long as cohort members reside in California. Linkage between the CTS cohort and the CCR database is based on full name, date of birth, address and social security number and includes manual review of possible matches. California and national mortality files were used to ascertain date and cause of death. Follow-up time was calculated as the number of days between the date of baseline questionnaire completion and the first occurrence of a first diagnosis of endometrial cancer. The end date of follow-up is defined as the date of endometrial cancer diagnosis, date of a move for 44 months out of California, date of death – or the end date of follow-up – whichever came first.",,"Participants provided detailed information on the baseline questionnaire regarding their recreational physical activity during various time periods in their lives. These time periods included: while in high school, between the ages of 18–24, 25–34, 35–44 and 45–54 years, and during the 3 years before completing the questionnaire, herein referred to as ‘baseline’ activity. For each time period, participants were asked to indicate the average amount of time spent participating in strenuous intensity physical activity (e.g., swimming laps, aerobics/calisthenics, running and jogging) and moderate-intensity activity (e.g., brisk walking, recreational tennis, golf, softball and volleyball). Participants reported the average number of hours per week (none, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4–6, 7–10, andX11 h per week) and average number of months per year (1–3, 4–6, 7–9 and 10–12 months per year) for each level of physical activity intensity in which they participated. For each time period and intensity level, the average annual hours per week was multiplied by months per year of participation and divided by total years to estimate average hours per week per year.

Beginning in 1997, follow-up questionnaires have been sent to participants every 2 years to update exposure information and to ascertain newly diagnosed cancers. Response rates among living cohort members are 88% or more.
Excluded from the analysis were 3,111 women lost to follow-up (i.e., alive at first follow-up but did not return any follow-up questionnaire), who reported prevalent cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) at enrollment (N 1?4 12,059), were pre/peri-menopausal (N 1?4 4,712), or missing information on recreational physical activity, sitting time, or BMI (N 1?4 4,222). Women who reported breast cancer on their first follow-up questionnaire, that was never verified, were also excluded (N 1?4 66).",73615 ,1,0,2,62.7,,,,LTPA,12.5,,916906.0,breast cancer,incidence,"Of the 4,760 incident breast cancer cases [International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) topography code C50] diagnosed among the cohort during follow-up, 4,662 cases were initially identified by self-report and sub- sequently verified by medical records or linkage with state cancer registries. Sensitivity of self-reported cancer in this cohort has been estimated to be 93% (11). An additional 98 incident cases were identified through automated linkage with the National Death Index (12), of which 78 were subsequently verified via linkage to state registries.

Beginning in 1997, follow-up questionnaires were sent to cohort members every 2 years to update exposure informa- tion and to ascertain newly diagnosed cancers. All follow-up ques- tionnaire response rates (after multiple mailings) among living cohort members are at least 88%. End of follow-up for the present analysis was June 30, 2003.
We excluded from this analysis 3,190 women who were lost to follow-up (i.e., alive at the first follow-up questionnaire in 1997 but did not return the 1997 or any subsequent follow-up question- naire), who reported prevalent cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) at baseline (N 5 12,053), who reported not being post- menopausal (N 5 4,291) or who had a hysterectomy or unknown hysterectomy status at baseline (N 5 30,724). We also excluded women with missing information on recreational physical activity at baseline (N 5 640) or BMI at baseline (N 5 756). To eliminate the strong effect of estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (ERT) on endometrial cancer and the possibility that reports of ERT only use were in error (because this regimen is contraindi- cated in women with an intact uterus), we excluded women who reported current ERT use in 1992 (N 5 1,583) and those with cur- rent or past postmenopausal hormone use of unknown type in 1992 (n 5 1,812). Finally, we excluded reported cases of endome- trial cancer that could not be verified through medical or cancer registry records (N 5 33) or cases with missing or potentially unrelated histologies such as endometrial stromal sarcoma (histol- ogy code 8930), adenosarcoma (code 8933), Mullerian mixed tumor (code 8950), endometrial adenofibroma (code 8381) and carcinosarcoma (code 8980) (n 5 32). The etiology of these less common tumors is thought to be different from endometrial carci- nomas. Women who did not return a 1999, 2001 or 2003 question- naire were censored at the return of their last questionnaire.

A MET, or metabolic equiva- lent, is the ratio of metabolic rate during a specific activity to rest- ing metabolic rate.27 Because of the older age of this population, the summary MET score for each participant was calculated by multiplying the lowest number of hours within each category times the moderate intensity MET score for each activity accord- ing to the Compendium of Physical Activities27 to provide conser- vatively estimated summary measures.

We excluded from this analysis 3,190 women who were lost to follow-up (i.e., alive at the first follow-up questionnaire in 1997 but did not return the 1997 or any subsequent follow-up question- naire), who reported prevalent cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) at baseline (N 5 12,053), who reported not being post- menopausal (N 5 4,291) or who had a hysterectomy or unknown hysterectomy status at baseline (N 5 30,724). We also excluded women with missing information on recreational physical activity at baseline (N 5 640) or BMI at baseline (N 5 756).

register linkage by identification numbers. Mortality data were obtained
from Statistics Finland and data on nonfatal events from the National
Hospital Discharge Register. The Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Revisions of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) were used to identify subarachnoid
hemorrhage (430 and I60), intracerebral hemorrhage (431 and
I61–I62), intracerebral infarction (432 to 438 and I63–I66), and any stroke
(430 to 438 and I60–I66) events. ICD-9 code 432 was classified as an
intracerebral hemorrhage. Stroke events that occurred before the baseline
survey were identified from the Hospital Discharge Register and excluded
from the analyses. The validity of the diagnosis of acute stroke in Finland is
good for hospital discharge register (agreement in 90%) and death register
(agreement in 97%).25 End points during follow-up were incident stroke
events, defined as either the first nonfatal stroke event or stroke death
without a preceding nonfatal event. Altogether, we identified cerebrovascular
2863 events (260 subarachnoid hemorrhage, 339 intracerebral hemorrhage,
and 2264 ischemic) during a mean follow-up of 19.0 years.",,Questionnaire,category,"Self-reported leisure time physical activity was classified into
3 categories: (1) low (almost completely inactive, eg, reading, watching
television, or doing some minor physical activity that was not of a
moderate or high level), (2) moderate (some physical activity for  4
hours per week, eg, walking, cycling, light gardening, but excluding
travel to work), and (3) high (vigorous physical activity for 3 hours per
week, eg, running, jogging, swimming, heavy gardening, or regular
exercise or competitive sports several times per week). Occupational
physical activity was classified as: (1) light (physically very easy, sitting
office work, eg, secretary), (2) moderate (standing and walking, eg, store
assistant, light industrial worker), and (3) active (walking and lifting, or
heavy manual labor, eg, industrial or farm work). The daily commuting
return journey was categorized into 3 categories: (1) using motorized
transportation or no work (0 minutes of walking or cycling), (2) walking
or bicycling 1 to 29 minutes, and (3) walking or bicycling for  30
minutes. Measurements of height, weight, systolic blood pressure

energy but in vigorous activities. With the growing recognition that it is difficult to persuade the many
sedentary individuals25 to take up vigorous activities, research interest
lately has focused on moderate intensity physical activity.37 Therefore,
we analyzed physical activity in a third way. We calculated the energy
expended on sports or recreation separately for light activities (,4.5
METs) and for activities of at least moderate intensity ($4.5 METs).
(Examples of moderate activities reported by alumni include dancing,
bicycling, snorkeling, and digging or filling in garden.) We used the same cut points as before in analyses. For light energy expenditure, men
distributed themselves thus: none, 63.9%; 1 to ,250, 10.3%; 250 to

the 1988 survey was a question on whether a physician had ever
diagnosed stroke and if so, the year of first diagnosis. Men who did not
provide this information were considered lost to follow-up and excluded
from study. Self-reported, physician-diagnosed chronic diseases among
alumni were believed to be valid.38–40 We used death certificates to
ascertain additional strokes (underlying or contributing cause of death)
not reported on the 1988 questionnaire. We traced deaths occurring
through 1990 using information from the alumni office to obtain death
certificates. Mortality follow-up in this cohort is .99% complete.38",,Questionnaire,kcal/wk,"Because
of interest in whether nonvigorous and vigorous activities have
equivalent benefits,36 we calculated separately energy expenditure
from nonvigorous (,6 METs) and vigorous ($6 METs) sports or
recreation.35 (Examples of vigorous activities reported by alumni
include jogging or running, swimming laps, playing tennis, and
shoveling snow.) For nonvigorous energy expenditure, we defined 5
categories: none (51.1% of men), 1 to ,250 (13.8%), 250 to ,600
(11.7%), 600 to ,1400 (12.0%), and $1400 kcal/wk (11.4%). For
vigorous energy expenditure, we did likewise (41.0%, 16.9%,
12.1%, 14.7%, and 15.3%, respectively). These cut points were
chosen so that among those who did report some sport or recreation,
men would be approximately evenly distributed among the remaining
4 categories of energy expenditure. Furthermore, the choice of
identical cut points would enable direct comparison of stroke rates
between, for example, men who expended 250 to ,600 kcal/wk in
nonvigorous activities and those who expended the same amount of
energy but in vigorous activities. With the growing recognition that it is difficult to persuade the many

The Spearman correlation between questionnaire-derived vigorous activity and resting pulse rate was ?0.45.",MET-hrs/wk,"Participants were divided into categories of physical activity (0, 0.1 –3.5, 3.6 – 8.8, 8.9 – 21, > 21 MET-hours/week) based on the distribution of vigorous- and moderate-intensity activity and informative cut points. For example, 3.5 MET-hrs/wk corresponds to 1 hour of moderate or 0.5 hours of vigorous activity, 8.8 MET-hrs/wk to 2.5 hours of moderate or 1.25 hours of vigorous activity (the current recommendations based on the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans) and 21 MET-hrs/wk to 6 – 7 hours of moderate or 3 hours of vigorous activity.","Vigorous activity, Moderate activity, Categories of Physical Activity",6449,hr,"Adjusts for parental history of MI at or before age 60 years, parental history of cancer at or before age 60 years, smoking, aspirin, vitamin E supplement use, intake of polyunsaturated fat, trans fat, EPA+DHA, and fiber, as well as alcohol intake and pre-existing disease including a diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia",,,8.9-21.0,3183,412128.0,22348,1.01,0.84,1.23,,,,,,,,,,,8.67,5.46,38.70,Author provided data on volume and duration,38.70,,,,8.67,,>21.0 MET-h/wk [assign: 27.05],47.37,,38.70,,,,,,,8.67,5.46,47.37,,38.70,,38.70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying cause of death was coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). Deaths were due to cancer (ICD-9 codes 140-239.9), cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease (ICD-9 codes 390-459.9), respiratory disease, including acute respiratory infections, pneumonia or influenza, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ICD-9 codes 460-519.9), injury (ICD-9 codes 800- 959.9), and other causes",,questionnaire,category ,"Participants were asked a general question about regular physical activity that has been used for over 3 decades by the Gallup poll: ""Aside from any work you do at home or at a job, do you do anything regularly—that is, on a daily basis—that helps keep you physically fit?"" Second, participants completed 2 questions asking how often they participate in moderate physical activity (eg, bowling, golf, light sports or physical exercise, gardening, or taking long walks) or vigorous activity (eg,jogging, racket sports, swimming, aerobics, or strenuous sports). Activities listed for moderate activity generally require 6.0 METs (work metabolic rate/resting metabolic rate) or less, while those listed for vigorous activity generally require greater than 6.0 METs.27 Response options to these questions ranged from ""rarely or never"" to ""more than 4 times a week."" Responses to the questions assessing moderate and vigorous activity were considered individually and were also combined to form a 3-level (low, medium, and high) physical activity index based on frequency and intensity of activity.

There was no additional follow-up information on physical activity and other variables after time of entry into the study until the end of mortality follow-up (Figure 1). At baseline, participants were asked for example, if “In the past month, did you run or jog?” and “In the past month, how often did you jog or run?” Similarly, questions were asked on walking, bicycling, swimming, aerobics and/or aerobic dancing, other dancing, calisthenics, yard work, lifting weights, and engagement in up to four other activities that were not mentioned in the survey. Frequency of engagement in activities over the past 30 days was reported. These responses were standardized to weekly frequency by using the conversion factors of 4.3 weeks/month and 30.4 days/month per NHANES III [15]. A validated intensity rating in metabolic equivalents (MET) was provided by NHANES III for each activity as defined in the Compendium of Physical Activities [16]. For exam- ple, jogging/running was assigned an intensity rating of “8 METS.” For this study, LTPA was classified as “low inten- sity,” “moderate” and “vigorous” using the standard cut-offs established by Pate et al. [17]. Activities requiring <3 METS were classified as “low-intensity,” activities requiring 3– 6 METS were classified as “moderate” and >6 METS were classified as “vigorous” [17]. Participants who did not re- port engagement in any of the activities, were classified as “inactive.” Because individuals engaging in “low intensity” activities represented <0.05% (n = 7) of the population, they were combined into the “moderate” activity group.
Next, participants were categorized as performing “reg- ular low-to-moderate” exercises if they reported performing the activity at least 5 times per week and “regular vigorous” if they reported performing vigorous activities at least 3 times per week. These categories were mutually exclusive (so that if an individual performed vigorous and low-to-moderate activities, he/she was included in the vigorous activity group and not in both groups). Additionally, a frequency-weighted LTPA variable was calculated by multiplying the frequency of each activity by its corresponding intensity value and summed. This variable was divided into quartiles in the regression models. The NHANES III survey did not collect information for duration of each bout of exercise, which limits more precise estimation of physical activity.

For exam- ple, jogging/running was assigned an intensity rating of “8 METS.” For this study, LTPA was classified as “low inten- sity,” “moderate” and “vigorous” using the standard cut-offs established by Pate et al. [17]. Activities requiring <3 METS were classified as “low-intensity,” activities requiring 3– 6 METS were classified as “moderate” and >6 METS were classified as “vigorous” [17]. Participants who did not re- port engagement in any of the activities, were classified as “inactive.” Because individuals engaging in “low intensity” activities represented <0.05% (n = 7) of the population, they were combined into the “moderate” activity group.
Next, participants were categorized as performing “reg- ular low-to-moderate” exercises if they reported performing the activity at least 5 times per week and “regular vigorous” if they reported performing vigorous activities at least 3 times per week. These categories were mutually exclusive (so that if an individual performed vigorous and low-to-moderate activities, he/she was included in the vigorous activity group and not in both groups). Additionally, a frequency-weighted LTPA variable was calculated by multiplying the frequency of each activity by its corresponding intensity value and summed. This variable was divided into quartiles in the regression models. The NHANES III survey did not collect information for duration of each bout of exercise, which limits more precise estimation of physical activity. The phy- sical activity definitions used in this study are consistent with previously published studies using the NHANES III popula- tion .",METS/week,Quartiles,,733,hr,"Adjusted for age, race, sex, smoking",,,1.16-10.47,164,56066.3,3738,0.87,0.65,1.15,,,,,,,Analysis including persons with existing cancer.,,,,,,16.21,,16.21,,,,,10.48-32 MET-h/wk [midpoint: 21.24],,21.24,,16.21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,P,,,NHANES III,Parekh et al.,2012,United States ,Prospective cohort,American civilian noninstitutionalized individuals ?17y.,"The NHANES III (1988–1994) pop- ulation, a national sample of civilian noninstitutionalized individuals, was selected through a complex, multistage probability design [12]. Persons who were 17+ or older were eligible for the mortality follow-up from the date of partic- ipation (1988–1994) through December 31, 2006. This rep- resents the last NHANES III mortality update. The current analyses included adults 20–89 years. Per the Adult Treat- ment Panel (ATP) definition, individuals were considered to be adults if they were at least 20 years old [13]. NHANES par- ticipants 89+ years were assigned an arbitrary age of 90 years for confidentiality purposes and were excluded from the ana- lyses. Pregnant women were excluded because their baseline physical activity and BMI may not be an accurate reflection of their usual activity or body weight. Additionally, persons with missing values for the pertinent variables were also excluded.

Mortality information was obtained from the updated NHANES III Linked Mortal- ity Files that provide mortality follow-up data from the date of participation in the survey (1988–1994) through Decem- ber 31, 2006 (Figure 1). Mortality was ascertained based upon either death certificates or from a probabilistic match between NHANES III and the National Center for Health Statistics, National Death Index (NDI) records. Cancer mortality was identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10; NCHS 2006; ICD-10 codes C00–C97). Persons were considered alive at the end of the follow-up period if they were not matched to a death record. Details of the mortality files are described elsewhere [22].",,"Leisure-Time Physical Activity. A question- naire consisting leisure-time physical activity questions including type of activity and frequency of the activity in the past month was queried in the Household Adult Ques tionnaire administered once at baseline. There was no additional follow-up information on physical activity and other variables after time of entry into the study until the end of mortality follow-up (Figure 1). At baseline, participants were asked for example, if “In the past month, did you run or jog?” and “In the past month, how often did you jog or run?” Similarly, questions were asked on walking, bicycling, swimming, aerobics and/or aerobic dancing, other dancing, calisthenics, yard work, lifting weights, and engagement in up to four other activities that were not mentioned in the survey. Frequency of engagement in activities over the past 30 days was reported. These responses were standardized to weekly frequency by using the conversion factors of 4.3 weeks/month and 30.4 days/month per NHANES III [15]. A validated intensity rating in metabolic equivalents (MET) was provided by NHANES III for each activity as defined in the Compendium of Physical Activities [16].

In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to the baseline questionnaire respondents to collect additional information on physical activity, menopausal HT use, medical history, and history of cancer. After excluding individuals who died (n=261) or moved out of the cancer registry ascertainment area (n=321) before their baseline questionnaire was received and scanned, proxy respondents to the baseline questionnaire (n=15,760), six individuals who withdrew from the study, and 325,174 men. In our analysis of baseline physical activity data, we excluded 23,911 women who reported a personal cancer history other than non-melanoma skin cancer, 82,132 who reported a prior hysterectomy, and 2,934 women with unknown hysterectomy status. We also excluded women who reported at baseline that their menstrual periods stopped due to surgery (n=1,829) or because of radiation or chemotherapy (n=117), 76 who developed non- epithelial endometrial cancer during follow-up, 8 with no follow-up, 421 (including 4 cases) who were missing baseline information on both daily routine and vigorous activity, and women with missing (n=3,530, including 31 cases) or extreme (defined as > two interquartile ranges from the mean; n=889, including 33 cases) values for baseline BMI (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters).",109621 ,1,0,2,,,,,LTPA,6.9,,760852.6,endometrial cancer,incidence,"Incident endometrial cancers were initially identified through probabilistic linkage to eight state cancer registries using first and last name, address, sex, date of birth, and Social Security Number. The cancer registry ascertainment area was recently expanded to include three additional states (TX, AZ, and NV) to capture cancer occurring among participants who moved to those states during follow-up. Histology was defined using International Classification of Diseases for Oncology codes, 3rd edition.31 A previous validation study in this cohort estimated that registry linkage validly identified approximately 90% of all incident cancers.",,"The baseline questionnaire captured several measures of physical activity. Participants were asked to select a response that best described their current daily routine activity, excluding exercise or sports: sit without walking very much; sit but walk fair amount; stand or walk a lot without carrying or lifting things; lift or carry light loads or climb stairs/hills often; or do heavy work or carry heavy loads. Participants were asked to indicate their frequency of vigorous physical activity during a typical month in the past 12 months: never, rarely, 1–3 times per month, 1–2 times per week, 3–4 times per week, or ? 5 times per week. Vigorous activity was defined as physical activity at work or home including exercise, sports, and carrying heavy loads that lasted ? 20 minutes and caused increases in breathing, heart rate, or sweating. Using the same response categories, participants were also asked to recall their frequency of participation in physical activities or sports during a typical month around the ages of 15–18 years old. We collapsed the never and rarely response categories for analysis.
The second questionnaire asked about several domains of physical activity: occupational, recreational and household, and physical inactivity. History of occupational physical activity was assessed by asking participants if they ever had a job requiring physically demanding work. Those responding affirmatively were asked to report the number of (none, 1–2, 3–5, or ? 6 jobs) and total number of years spent (none or <1 year, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or ? 10 years) in these jobs. The second questionnaire also assessed whether participants ever had a job in which they walked or biked to work for most days of the week and if so, the total number of years they did so (none, <1 year, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or ? 10 years). We combined the none and <1 year response categories for analysis.
Participants were instructed not to include occupational physical activity when reporting how often they participated in “light” and “moderate and vigorous” recreational and household activities. They could choose from the following options: never, rarely, weekly but <1 hour per week, 1–3 hours per week, 4–7 hours per week, and >7 hours per week. Participants were asked to read lists of examples of “light” and “moderate and vigorous” recreational and household activities and to select the option that best described how often they participated during various ages and time periods: 15–18, 19–29, and 35–39 years old, and in the past 10 years. The never and rarely response categories were collapsed for analysis. Since these physical activity questions captured frequency and dose, we calculated hours exercised per week and metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week using the Compendium of Physical Activities as a guide.30 First, midpoint values were used for each category of reported frequency/dose of participation in weekly activity: never/rarely was assigned a value of 0 hours; <1 hour per week was assigned a value of 0.5 hours; 1–3 hours per week was assigned a value of 2 hours; 4–7 hours per week was assigned a value of 5.5 hours; and >7 hours per week was assigned a value of 8 hours. MET values were then assigned to each level of activity: light activities, 3.0 MET; and moderate/vigorous activities, 7.0 MET. These MET values were multiplied by the values of activity hours per week and summed across the activity levels to determine MET-hours per week for each of the various ages and time periods.
Information on physical inactivity was based on two questions. Participants were asked about time spent watching TV or videos during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months. Time spent watching TV or videos was categorized as none, <1 hour, 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and ? 9 hours. In a separate question, participants were also asked to indicate the number of hours spent sitting during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months: <3, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and ? 9 hours. Both measures of inactivity were collapsed as <3, 3–4, 5–6, and ? 7 hours per day.",frequency (of at least 20 mins of vigorous activity),,"Current daily routine activity at work or home; Frequency of participation in physical activities or sports during typical month between ages 15–18 years

Participants were asked to select a response that best described their current daily routine activity, excluding exercise or sports: sit without walking very much; sit but walk fair amount; stand or walk a lot without carrying or lifting things; lift or carry light loads or climb stairs/hills often; or do heavy work or carry heavy loads. Participants were asked to indicate their frequency of vigorous physical activity during a typical month in the past 12 months: never, rarely, 1–3 times per month, 1–2 times per week, 3–4 times per week, or ? 5 times per week. Vigorous activity was defined as physical activity at work or home including exercise, sports, and carrying heavy loads that lasted ? 20 minutes and caused increases in breathing, heart rate, or sweating. Using the same response categories, participants were also asked to recall their frequency of participation in physical activities or sports during a typical month around the ages of 15–18 years old. We collapsed the never and rarely response categories for analysis.
The second questionnaire asked about several domains of physical activity: occupational, recreational and household, and physical inactivity. History of occupational physical activity was assessed by asking participants if they ever had a job requiring physically demanding work. Those responding affirmatively were asked to report the number of (none, 1–2, 3–5, or ? 6 jobs) and total number of years spent (none or <1 year, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or ? 10 years) in these jobs. The second questionnaire also assessed whether participants ever had a job in which they walked or biked to work for most days of the week and if so, the total number of years they did so (none, <1 year, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or ? 10 years). We combined the none and <1 year response categories for analysis.
Participants were instructed not to include occupational physical activity when reporting how often they participated in “light” and “moderate and vigorous” recreational and household activities. They could choose from the following options: never, rarely, weekly but <1 hour per week, 1–3 hours per week, 4–7 hours per week, and >7 hours per week. Participants were asked to read lists of examples of “light” and “moderate and vigorous” recreational and household activities and to select the option that best described how often they participated during various ages and time periods: 15–18, 19–29, and 35–39 years old, and in the past 10 years. The never and rarely response categories were collapsed for analysis. Since these physical activity questions captured frequency and dose, we calculated hours exercised per week and metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week using the Compendium of Physical Activities as a guide.30 First, midpoint values were used for each category of reported frequency/dose of participation in weekly activity: never/rarely was assigned a value of 0 hours; <1 hour per week was assigned a value of 0.5 hours; 1–3 hours per week was assigned a value of 2 hours; 4–7 hours per week was assigned a value of 5.5 hours; and >7 hours per week was assigned a value of 8 hours. MET values were then assigned to each level of activity: light activities, 3.0 MET; and moderate/vigorous activities, 7.0 MET. These MET values were multiplied by the values of activity hours per week and summed across the activity levels to determine MET-hours per week for each of the various ages and time periods.
Information on physical inactivity was based on two questions. Participants were asked about time spent watching TV or videos during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months. Time spent watching TV or videos was categorized as none, <1 hour, 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and ? 9 hours.

Respon- dents were members of AARP between the ages of 50–71 years old at baseline and residing in one of eight study areas (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, and metropolitan Atlanta and Detroit). In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to respondents who did not have self-reported prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer at baseline to collect more detailed information on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Among baseline questionnaire respondents, we excluded 179 duplicate questionnaires, 15,760 individuals whose questionnaires were completed by proxies for the intended respondents, 582 persons who died or moved out of the study area before study entry, and 6 people who withdrew from the study. We also excluded 51,193 persons with a previous cancer diagnosis, 997 persons reporting end-stage renal disease, 5,711 subjects with missing information on physical activity, and 4,021 persons who were statistical outliers on reported energy intake.

For matching purposes, we have virtually complete data on first and last name, address history, gender, and date of birth. All suspected matches underwent a process that rejects those with insufficient degree of similarity to confirm a true match (approximately 4%); uncertain matches underwent final manual review. We conducted a validation study of cancer endpoint ascertainment by linking a subset of our cohort (n = 12,000) to the cancer registries and comparing the data to self-reports and subsequent medical record confirmation of incident cancer in this sub-cohort. We found that approximately 90% of all incident cancers were accurately identified using the registries included in this cohort as the gold standard [42]. We used the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition, to classify incident cases of colon cancer (C180–189). Colon cancers were further subdivided into cancers of the proximal colon (C180–184) and distal colon (C185–187). Participants diagnosed simultaneously with a colon and rectal cancer were included in both colon and rectal cancer analyses.",,"The baseline questionnaire asked participants to provide information about the number of times per week during the last 12 months they engaged in periods of physical activity or sports that lasted at least 20 min and caused increases in breathing or heart rate, or caused them to work up a sweat (i.e., current exercise/sports). There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week. Subjects were also asked to indicate which of the following categories best described their routine through- out the day at home or work (i.e., daily routine activity): sitting, sitting and walking, standing or walking but not lifting or carrying things, carrying light loads or climbing stairs, and carrying heavy loads or doing heavy work.
The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category. A total physi- cal activity score was created by summing the MET-hours per week of low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity reported during each age period. A lifetime phys- ical activity score was created by averaging the total physical activity scores calculated for each age period.
The second questionnaire also requested information on sedentary behavior by asking about the average number of hours per day currently spent watching television or videos, and the average number of hours per day spent sitting. The response options for those items were as follows: none; less than1h;1–2h;3–4h;5–6h;7–8h;and9ormorehours.

One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40].

Respon- dents were members of AARP between the ages of 50–71 years old at baseline and residing in one of eight study areas (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, and metropolitan Atlanta and Detroit). In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to respondents who did not have self-reported prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer at baseline to collect more detailed information on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Among baseline questionnaire respondents, we excluded 179 duplicate questionnaires, 15,760 individuals whose questionnaires were completed by proxies for the intended respondents, 582 persons who died or moved out of the study area before study entry, and 6 people who withdrew from the study. We also excluded 51,193 persons with a previous cancer diagnosis, 997 persons reporting end-stage renal disease, 5,711 subjects with missing information on physical activity, and 4,021 persons who were statistical outliers on reported energy intake.

We conducted a validation study of cancer endpoint ascertainment by linking a subset of our cohort (n = 12,000) to the cancer registries and comparing the data to self-reports and subsequent medical record confirmation of incident cancer in this sub-cohort. We found that approximately 90% of all incident cancers were accurately identified using the registries included in this cohort as the gold standard [42]. We used the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition, to classify incident cases of colon cancer (C180–189). Colon cancers were further subdivided into cancers of the proximal colon (C180–184) and distal colon (C185–187).

There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week. Subjects were also asked to indicate which of the following categories best described their routine through- out the day at home or work (i.e., daily routine activity): sitting, sitting and walking, standing or walking but not lifting or carrying things, carrying light loads or climbing stairs, and carrying heavy loads or doing heavy work.
The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category. A total physi- cal activity score was created by summing the MET-hours per week of low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity reported during each age period. A lifetime phys- ical activity score was created by averaging the total physical activity scores calculated for each age period.
The second questionnaire also requested information on sedentary behavior by asking about the average number of hours per day currently spent watching television or videos, and the average number of hours per day spent sitting.

In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to respondents who did not have self-reported prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer at baseline to collect more detailed information on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Among baseline questionnaire respondents, we excluded 179 duplicate questionnaires, 15,760 individuals whose questionnaires were completed by proxies for the intended respondents, 582 persons who died or moved out of the study area before study entry, and 6 people who withdrew from the study. We also excluded 51,193 persons with a previous cancer diagnosis, 997 persons reporting end-stage renal disease, 5,711 subjects with missing information on physical activity, and 4,021 persons who were statistical outliers on reported energy intake.

There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week.

The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week.

Respon- dents were members of AARP between the ages of 50–71 years old at baseline and residing in one of eight study areas (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, and metropolitan Atlanta and Detroit). In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to respondents who did not have self-reported prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer at baseline to collect more detailed information on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Among baseline questionnaire respondents, we excluded 179 duplicate questionnaires, 15,760 individuals whose questionnaires were completed by proxies for the intended respondents, 582 persons who died or moved out of the study area before study entry, and 6 people who withdrew from the study. We also excluded 51,193 persons with a previous cancer diagnosis, 997 persons reporting end-stage renal disease, 5,711 subjects with missing information on physical activity, and 4,021 persons who were statistical outliers on reported energy intake.

For matching purposes, we have virtually complete data on first and last name, address history, gender, and date of birth. All suspected matches underwent a process that rejects those with insufficient degree of similarity to confirm a true match (approximately 4%); uncertain matches underwent final manual review. We conducted a validation study of cancer endpoint ascertainment by linking a subset of our cohort (n = 12,000) to the cancer registries and comparing the data to self-reports and subsequent medical record confirmation of incident cancer in this sub-cohort. We found that approximately 90% of all incident cancers were accurately identified using the registries included in this cohort as the gold standard [42]. We used the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition, to classify incident cases of colon cancer (C180–189). Colon cancers were further subdivided into cancers of the proximal colon (C180–184) and distal colon (C185–187).

There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week. Subjects were also asked to indicate which of the following categories best described their routine through- out the day at home or work (i.e., daily routine activity): sitting, sitting and walking, standing or walking but not lifting or carrying things, carrying light loads or climbing stairs, and carrying heavy loads or doing heavy work.
The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category.

In 4 municipalities of county of Finnmark, all women in the youngest age group were asked to meet. Of 31,509 invited women, 28,562 (90.6%) attended. In 1977–1981, those who registered at the first screening were re-invited, while a 5–11% random sample of women, aged 20–39 years, was invited for the first time. A total of 34,378 women were asked to participate and 31,209 (90.8%) actually did; 26,127 women attended both surveys. We restricted our study to women who were alive with no diagnosis of any malignant disease 1 year after participation in the second survey (1977–1981, n   25,642). Only women with com- plete data from both surveys on parity, recreational and occupa- tional activity, and the main clinical parameters [height, weight, blood pressure and non-fasting serum glucose (survey 1)] were included (n   24,460).

Prevalence and incidence of cancer cases were identified through linkage to the Cancer Registry of Norway. Women with an incident, primary, histopathologically confirmed carcinoma of the endometrium were defined as cases. Since 1952, clinicians and pathologists in Norway have been required to report all new cancer cases. An accurate and complete database is achieved through matching with the Register of Deaths at Statistics Norway (SSB). Information about reproductive history, emigration and death was gathered by linkage to SSB. Women were considered to be at risk from the date of the blood sample in the 1977–1981 survey (baseline) through 31 December 1996, or earlier on the occurrence of emigration, death or diagnosis of any cancer. ",,"The women marked their usual level of recreational and occupational activity on a scale with the following 4 grades: Recreational activity: Grade 1, Reading, watching television or other sedentary activity; Grade 2, Walking, bicycling or other activity for at least 4 hr per week; Grade 3, Recreational athletics, heavy gardening or similar activities at least 4 hr per week; and Grade 4, Regular (several times a week) training or participation in athletic competitions. Occupational activity: Grade 1, Mostly sedentary work; Grade 2, A lot of walking; Grade 3, A lot of walking and lifting; and Grade 4, Heavy manual work.",,"With regard to physical activity, the 2 uppermost levels were merged because only a few participants engaged in the most strenuous activities (grade 4 recreational: n   52, 0.2% of included and grade 4 occupational: n   1,331, 5.5% of included). Furthermore, for both recreational and occupational activity, a new variable was created containing information from both surveys. Women who reported sedentary activity (grade 1) in both surveys were charac- terized as “consistently sedentary.” Those who reported minimum grade 2 level of activity in the first survey and minimum grade 3 in the next were characterized as “consistently active.” The re- maining women who were neither consistently sedentary nor con- sistently active were characterized as “moderately active.”",,130,rr,"Adjusted for age, geographical region, height, body mass index, recreational or occupational activity and smoking at baseline and parity.

Every 2 years since 1976, the Nurses have been sent questionnaires to ascertain their current lifestyle habits and disease history. Dietary intake was first as- sessed in 1980 and subsequently in 1984, 1986 and every 4 years since 1986. At baseline, it was comprised of 51,529 male dentists, optometrists, osteopaths, podiatrists, phar- macists and veterinarians between 40 and 75 years of age in 1986. The cohort is sent a questionnaire every 2 years to update infor- mation on current lifestyle habits and disease history. Dietary intake was first assessed in 1986 and every 4 years since then. We excluded any participants who reported previous cancer (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer), ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease or familial polyposis syndrome at baseline. We also ex- cluded individuals who reported implausible caloric intakes ( 800 or  4,200 kcal for men and  600 or  3,500 kcal for women) or who had a significant number of items left blank on the FFQ (10 or more blank out of the 61 question food-frequency questionnaire in 1980 for the women, or 70 or more on the 131 item food- frequency questionnaire in 1986 for the men).",134365 ,1,0.35,3,,,,,LTPA,17.1,,2302712.0,colon cancer,incidence,"For both cohorts, each mailed biennial questionnaire ascertained whether a participant was diagnosed with cancer or other disease outcomes within the previous 2 years.

A physician reviewed the medical records to verify infor- mation on histological type, anatomic location and stage of the cancer. Most deaths in these cohorts were reported by family members or the postal system. The National Death Index was used to identify deaths among nonrespondents and has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive.",,"All exposure information was based on data collected via the biennial questionnaires. For physical activity in the HPFS, we divided the men into quintiles based on their MET hours per week of activity at baseline (1986). To calculate the MET hours per week, we multiplied the time spent on each activity asked about (walking or hiking out- doors, jogging, running, bicycling, lap swimming, tennis, squash or racquetball and calisthenics or rowing) by the typical energy expenditure for that activity expressed in metabolic equivalents. We also added in METS for the number of flights of stairs climbed daily and the usual walking pace. The validity of the MET-hours per week has been studied and reported previously in the NHS II cohort (a cohort similar to the NHS cohort) as well as the HPFS.21,22 We used the medians of each of the quintiles for the linear tests of trend and in the polytomous logistic regression.
In the NHS, we were unable to derive MET-hours comparable to the men until the 1986 questionnaire. Thus, to keep the fol- low-up period consistent for men and women and to use all cases that arose in the follow-up period, we used the responses on the 1980 questionnaire to classify participants into 5 physical activity categories. More specifically, in 1980 the nurses reported whether they engaged in exercise intensely enough to produce sweating and then the intensity of the specific activity that they reported engag- ing in most frequently. Women who reported never sweating were classified as low activity (the reference group). Women were considered to have moderate physical activity if they reported sweating and engaged in a moderately intense activity (i.e., a metabolic equivalent score between 1 and 4). Participants who reported sweating and engaged in vigorous activity (MET score of 4 or more) were categorized as high activity. We further divided the moderate category into those who engaged in moderate activity less than 2 times a week or 2 or more times per week. The high activity category was also further divided into those who reported 4 to 6 METS and those with more than 6 METS. Thus, we had 5 categories based on a combination of sweating or not, and MET scores for their primary physical activity. A similar derivation of physical activity in this cohort has been published previously.23 Starting in 1986, we were able to directly calculate a MET hours per week for each NHS participant.

More specifically, in 1980 the nurses reported whether they engaged in exercise intensely enough to produce sweating and then the intensity of the specific activity that they reported engag- ing in most frequently. Women who reported never sweating were classified as low activity (the reference group). Women were considered to have moderate physical activity if they reported sweating and engaged in a moderately intense activity (i.e., a metabolic equivalent score between 1 and 4). Participants who reported sweating and engaged in vigorous activity (MET score of 4 or more) were categorized as high activity. We further divided the moderate category into those who engaged in moderate activity less than 2 times a week or 2 or more times per week. The high activity category was also further divided into those who reported 4 to 6 METS and those with more than 6 METS. Thus, we had 5 categories based on a combination of sweating or not, and MET scores for their primary physical activity. A similar derivation of physical activity in this cohort has been published previously.23 Starting in 1986, we were able to directly calculate a MET hours per week for each NHS participant.

The response rate in the initial invitation cycle was 71%, and response rates of approximately 90% have been achieved in each follow-up cycle. At the start of follow-up in 1986, when detailed physical activity was first assessed, we excluded nurses who had died or reported previous cancers except non-melanoma skin can- cer (N510,174), reported a hysterectomy or surgical meno- pause (N531,666), or were missing all activity data during follow-up (N 5 8,290).

Women diagnosed with non-epithelial tumors (N5129), types of epithelial tumors other than adenocarcinoma (e.g., squamous cell) (N 5 127) or non-invasive tumors (endome- trial intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical hyperplasia or adeno- carcinoma in situ) (N 5 288) were censored during follow- up.",,"Detailed information on recreational physical activity during the past year was assessed by questionnaire in 1986. Partici- pants reported their average weekly time spent on any of eight activities: walking or hiking, jogging, running, bicycling, lap swimming, playing tennis, calisthenics/aerobics/aerobic dance/rowing machine and playing squash or racquetball. Participants also reported their usual walking pace and the number of flights of stairs climbed daily. These questions were repeated, with minor changes, every 2–4 years (1988, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2004). Starting in 1992, information was collected on other lower intensity (e.g., yoga, stretching and toning) and vigorous (e.g., lawn mowing) activities. Starting in 1990, participants were asked whether their health limited them in performing typical activities (e.g., walking 1 block, moderate activities and vigorous activities). Physical activity data were carried forward when activity was not included on the biennial questionnaires (e.g., 1988 data used in the 1990–1992 follow-up). However, activity data were not carried forward when women failed to answer phys- ical activity questions (e.g., 1992 data were not carried for- ward if a woman was missing 1994 data).
To incorporate activity frequency, duration and intensity, we calculated total metabolic equivalent (MET) hours of activity per week (MET-hr/week).20,21 During each question- naire cycle, participants with unreasonably high levels of activity (1251 MET-hr/week, or approximately 6 hr per day of average recreational walking) were assigned missing activ- ity values. In analyses of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activities, we defined a priori only brisk or very brisk walk- ing, jogging or running as moderate or vigorous activity. Because of the variable intensity with which activities such as swimming and biking may be performed, excluding these activities may reduce potential misclassification of moderate or vigorous activity.18 In analyses of walking and walking pace, however, we were interested specifically in whether walking was beneficial even if women did not perform any vigorous activities. We thus used a more general definition of vigorous activities, which included any activities that were potentially vigorous (6 METs or greater: jogging, running, bicycling, swimming, tennis, calisthenics/aerobics, racquet sports and other vigorous activity) in analyses of walking.22 We categorized total recreational activity into multiples of 3 as 3 METs represents 1 hr of average walking.20 Moderate or vigorous activity was categorized by hours per week for increased comparability to existing physical activity guidelines.22 For adequate statistical power to examine high levels of activity, we selected category cut points that resulted in an approximately even distribution of cases in higher activity categories.
The reproducibility and validity of these questions have been described previously.23 In a similar population of NHS II participants (N 5 151), the correlation over a 1-year period between activity reported by questionnaire and that assessed by past-week recalls was 0.79, and the correlation between moderate or vigorous activity reported by questionnaire and that assessed by activity diaries was 0.62.",MET-hr/week,We categorized total recreational activity into multiples of 3 as 3 METs represents 1 hr of average walking.,Moderate or vigorous-intensity activity ,683,rr,"Adjusted for age at menarche (7–12, >12–13, >13–18, missing years), OC use (never, <1, 1 to <3, 3 to <6, ??6, missing years), parity and age at first birth (nulliparous, 1–2 children <25 years, 1–2 children 25–29 years, 1–2 children ??30 years, 3–4 children <25 years, 3–4 children 25–29 years, 3–4 children ??30 years, ??5 children <25 years, ??5 children ??25 years, missing), age at last birth (nulliparous, <25, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, ??40, missing years), menopausal status (pre-, post-, dubious or missing), age at menopause (continuous), HT (never, past, current <5 years, cur- rent ??5 years, missing), HT type (never, E only, E1P, other, missing), BMI at age 18 (<19, 19 to <21, 21 to <23, ??23, missing kg/m2), pack-years of smoking (0, 0 to <20, 20 to <40, ??40, missing), family history of endometrial cancer (yes, no), family history of colorectal cancer (yes, no), alco- hol intake (none, <5, 5 to <15, ??15, missing g/day) and caffeine intake (quartiles, missing) and recent BMI (continuous).","Adjusted for age at menarche (7–12, >12–13, >13–18, missing years), OC use (never, <1, 1 to <3, 3 to <6, ??6, missing years), parity and age at first birth (nulliparous, 1–2 children <25 years, 1–2 children 25–29 years, 1–2 children ??30 years, 3–4 children <25 years, 3–4 children 25–29 years, 3–4 children ??30 years, ??5 children <25 years, ??5 children ??25 years, missing), age at last birth (nulliparous, <25, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, ??40, missing years), menopausal status (pre-, post-, dubious or missing), age at menopause (continuous), HT (never, past, current <5 years, cur- rent ??5 years, missing), HT type (never, E only, E1P, other, missing), BMI at age 18 (<19, 19 to <21, 21 to <23, ??23, missing kg/m2), pack-years of smoking (0, 0 to <20, 20 to <40, ??40, missing), family history of endometrial cancer (yes, no), family history of colorectal cancer (yes, no), alco- hol intake (none, <5, 5 to <15, ??15, missing g/day) and caffeine intake (quartiles, missing).",,We categorized total recreational activity into multiples of 3 as 3 METs represents 1 hr of average walking.,112,152164.0,10788,1,,,,,,,,,PA assessment is culumative average,,,,0.20,6.50,0.96,"Authors provided MET.h/wk categories.

Physical activity data were carried forward when activity was not included on the biennial questionnaires (e.g., 1988 data used in the 1990–1992 follow-up). However, activity data were not carried forward when women failed to answer phys- ical activity questions (e.g., 1992 data were not carried for- ward if a woman was missing 1994 data).
To incorporate activity frequency, duration and intensity, we calculated total metabolic equivalent (MET) hours of activity per week (MET-hr/week).20,21 During each question- naire cycle, participants with unreasonably high levels of activity (1251 MET-hr/week, or approximately 6 hr per day of average recreational walking) were assigned missing activ- ity values. In analyses of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activities, we defined a priori only brisk or very brisk walk- ing, jogging or running as moderate or vigorous activity. Because of the variable intensity with which activities such as swimming and biking may be performed, excluding these activities may reduce potential misclassification of moderate or vigorous activity.18 In analyses of walking and walking pace, however, we were interested specifically in whether walking was beneficial even if women did not perform any vigorous activities. We thus used a more general definition of vigorous activities, which included any activities that were potentially vigorous (6 METs or greater: jogging, running, bicycling, swimming, tennis, calisthenics/aerobics, racquet sports and other vigorous activity) in analyses of walking.22 We categorized total recreational activity into multiples of 3 as 3 METs represents 1 hr of average walking.20 Moderate or vigorous activity was categorized by hours per week for increased comparability to existing physical activity guidelines.22 For adequate statistical power to examine high levels of activity, we selected category cut points that resulted in an approximately even distribution of cases in higher activity categories.
The reproducibility and validity of these questions have been described previously.23 In a similar population of NHS II participants (N 5 151), the correlation over a 1-year period between activity reported by questionnaire and that assessed by past-week recalls was 0.79, and the correlation between moderate or vigorous activity reported by questionnaire and that assessed by activity diaries was 0.62.",MET-hr/week,We categorized total recreational activity into multiples of 3 as 3 METs represents 1 hr of average walking.,Moderate or vigorous-intensity activity ,683,rr,"Adjusted for age at menarche (7–12, >12–13, >13–18, missing years), OC use (never, <1, 1 to <3, 3 to <6, ??6, missing years), parity and age at first birth (nulliparous, 1–2 children <25 years, 1–2 children 25–29 years, 1–2 children ??30 years, 3–4 children <25 years, 3–4 children 25–29 years, 3–4 children ??30 years, ??5 children <25 years, ??5 children ??25 years, missing), age at last birth (nulliparous, <25, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, ??40, missing years), menopausal status (pre-, post-, dubious or missing), age at menopause (continuous), HT (never, past, current <5 years, cur- rent ??5 years, missing), HT type (never, E only, E1P, other, missing), BMI at age 18 (<19, 19 to <21, 21 to <23, ??23, missing kg/m2), pack-years of smoking (0, 0 to <20, 20 to <40, ??40, missing), family history of endometrial cancer (yes, no), family history of colorectal cancer (yes, no), alco- hol intake (none, <5, 5 to <15, ??15, missing g/day) and caffeine intake (quartiles, missing) and recent BMI (continuous).","Adjusted for age at menarche (7–12, >12–13, >13–18, missing years), OC use (never, <1, 1 to <3, 3 to <6, ??6, missing years), parity and age at first birth (nulliparous, 1–2 children <25 years, 1–2 children 25–29 years, 1–2 children ??30 years, 3–4 children <25 years, 3–4 children 25–29 years, 3–4 children ??30 years, ??5 children <25 years, ??5 children ??25 years, missing), age at last birth (nulliparous, <25, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, ??40, missing years), menopausal status (pre-, post-, dubious or missing), age at menopause (continuous), HT (never, past, current <5 years, cur- rent ??5 years, missing), HT type (never, E only, E1P, other, missing), BMI at age 18 (<19, 19 to <21, 21 to <23, ??23, missing kg/m2), pack-years of smoking (0, 0 to <20, 20 to <40, ??40, missing), family history of endometrial cancer (yes, no), family history of colorectal cancer (yes, no), alco- hol intake (none, <5, 5 to <15, ??15, missing g/day) and caffeine intake (quartiles, missing).",,9-<18,98,148550.0,10532,0.78,0.59,1.03,,,,,,,PA assessment is culumative average,,,,4.45,5.06,17.20,,17.20,,,,4.45,18-<27 MET-h/wk [midpoint: 22.5],,22.50,,18.05,,,,,,,4.45,5.06,22.50,,18.05,,18.05,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biennially thereafter, participants received follow-up questionnaires to update information on lifestyle factors, including endometrial cancer risk factors, and new disease diagnoses. The response rate in the initial invitation cycle was 71%, and response rates of approximately 90% have been achieved in each follow-up cycle. At the start of follow-up in 1986, when detailed physical activity was first assessed, we excluded nurses who had died or reported previous cancers except non-melanoma skin can- cer (N510,174), reported a hysterectomy or surgical meno- pause (N531,666), or were missing all activity data during follow-up (N 5 8,290).

To confirm cancer diagno- ses, study physicians masked to exposure status reviewed medical records after obtaining permission from participants. Data were collected on histological type, presence of invasion and stage as well as grade. In this analysis, we included cases of invasive endometrial adenocarcinoma (ICD-O histology code 8380/3) because of potential heterogeneity by histologi- cal subtype. Cases were defined by the 1988 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria as stage IA to IVB diagnosed from 1986 to May 2008 and con- firmed by medical records (99% of reported cases confirmed). Women diagnosed with non-epithelial tumors (N5129), types of epithelial tumors other than adenocarcinoma (e.g., squamous cell) (N 5 127) or non-invasive tumors (endome- trial intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical hyperplasia or adeno- carcinoma in situ) (N 5 288) were censored during follow- up.",,"Detailed information on recreational physical activity during the past year was assessed by questionnaire in 1986. Partici- pants reported their average weekly time spent on any of eight activities: walking or hiking, jogging, running, bicycling, lap swimming, playing tennis, calisthenics/aerobics/aerobic dance/rowing machine and playing squash or racquetball. Participants also reported their usual walking pace and the number of flights of stairs climbed daily. These questions were repeated, with minor changes, every 2–4 years (1988, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2004). Starting in 1992, information was collected on other lower intensity (e.g., yoga, stretching and toning) and vigorous (e.g., lawn mowing) activities.

cohort consisted of the women who returned
the 1980 questionnaire and answered
the physical activity questions (n=85326). We
excluded women at baseline with a history of
cardiovascular disease or cancer (n=4978); as
a result, 80348 women were included in analyses
that began in 1980",80348 ,1,0,2,46.3,,,,LTPA,14.0,,1270498.0,all-cause mortality,mortality,"The primary endpoint in this analysiswas death

activity on the 1980 questionnaire. We used a
single question about the average number of
hours spent each week during the previous year
on such activities as heavy gardening, vigorous
sports, jogging, walking or striding, bicycling,
or heavy housework. On the 1982 questionnaire women were asked a slightly different
question: “For how many hours per week, on
average, do you engage in activity strenuous
enough to build up a sweat?”
In 1986, 1988, and 1992, the physical activity
questions were more detailed (there were
no physical activity questions on the 1990 survey);
women were asked to report the average
time spent per week during the previous year
on each of the following activities: walking or
hiking outdoors, jogging (slower than 10 minutes
per mile), running (10 minutes per mile
or faster), bicycling (including use of a stationary
bicycle), swimming, playing tennis or
squash, and participating in calisthenics, aerobics,
or aerobic dance or using a rowing machine.
Each woman also reported her usual
walking pace: easy (less than 2 miles [3.2 km]
per hour), normal (2–2.9 miles per hour), brisk
(3–3.9 miles per hour), or very brisk (4 miles
per hour or faster). Thus, for 1980, 1982, 1986,
1988, and 1992, we had a measure of average
hours per week of physical activity. For 1986,
1988, and 1992, we also created variables representing
average hours per week of walking
and of more vigorous (nonwalking) physical
activity.",None,4746,rr,"Adjusted for age, smoking status, recent alcohol consumption, height, body mass index, and postmenopausal hormone use",,,4 - 6.9,216,72653.0,4595,0.71,0.61,0.82,,,,,,,"In primary analyses,we lagged deaths by

Although most of these activities were recreational, walking could be nonrecreational. For each activity, women chose one of 10 duration categories that ranged from zero to 11 or more hours per week. Walking pace was also reported as easy, average, brisk, or very brisk. Activity was reassessed in 1991 and 1997.Each activity on the questionnaire was assigned a metabolic equivalent (MET) score based on the classification by Ainsworth et al (1993). The MET score for an activity is defined as the ratio of the metabolic rate associated with that activity divided by the resting metabolic rate. For example, walking at an average pace, jogging, and running were assigned MET scores of 3, 7 and 12, respectively. We calculated MET-hweek??1 for each activity as the reported hours per week engaged in the activity multiplied by the assigned MET score, and the values from the individual activities were summed for a total MET-hweek??1.

In addition to total mortal- ity, we also examined deaths from cancer (codes 140–208).",,"At baseline, participants were asked by trained interview- ers who were using a structured physical activity question- naire to provide information on exercise participation within the 5 years before the interview. Participants were first asked whether they participated in any form of exercise on a weekly basis. Regular exercise was defined as engaging in leisure-time exercise of any type and intensity at least once per week. Men who exercised regularly were further asked to list the 3 exercises in which they most frequently engaged and then were asked questions about the average amount of time spent per week on each exercise and the number of years of participation. In addition to exercise participation, information was also obtained from all participants on other forms of physical activity, including household-, transportation-, and occupation-related physical activity. To assess exercise intensity, a standard metabolic equivalent (MET) score was assigned to each exercise according to pre- viously established criteria (walking, 3.3 METs; Tai Chi, 4.0 METs; jogging, 7.0 METs, etc.) (23). We calculated MET- hours per day for each type of exercise and each other form of physical activity by multiplying the MET score by time spent on the activity. The total MET-hours per day were then estimated by summing the MET-hours per day for each activity.
The reproducibility and validity of the physical activity questionnaire used in the SMHS were evaluated in a random sample of 196 participants and found to be reasonably high (24).

Mid-low was def?ned as subjects who spent 30 or more minutes a day on any kind of physical activity 1–2 days per week. Mid-high was def?ned as subjects who spent 30 or more minutes a day on any kind of physical activity 3–4 days per week. High was def?ned as subjects who spent 30 or more minutes a day on any kind of physical activity 5 or more days per week",analysis also conducted with activity categories defined according walking for transport and non-exercise PA,332,hr,"age, sex, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, SES, mental health, self-rated health, and treatment of certain kinds of disease at baseline (stroke, hypertension, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, fracture, gastrointestinal disease, lung disease, joint disease, others)",,,5+ days/wk ,52,10638.0,2003,0.82,0.58,1.17,,,,,,,,,5.50,0.75,4.13,4.50,14.44,Paper reports frequency and duration.

Cause-specific categories of mortality were classified as cancer (International Classi- fication of Diseases, 10th Revision codes C00-C97).",,"A wide range of “usual” amounts of physical activity and sedentary behavior performed at home, at work, and during leisure time were assessed. Physical activity level was as- sessed by asking about time typically spent performing light, moderate, and strenuous (vigorous) activities at home and at work, as well as time spent moderately and vigorously exercising/participating in sports. Time spent doing work and home activities was assessed separately for week and week- end days, and exercise and sports participation was assessed for a typical week. Overall physical activity level was esti- mated as the sum of home and work activity and exercise and sports participation. In addition to leisure-time activity and activities done at home and work, time spent walking slowly (moving around, walking at work, walking a dog, doing light exercise) and walking quickly (to go places, for exercise, climbing stairs) was also assessed and evaluated separately. Questions about sedentary behaviors asked about the amount of time per day typically spent sitting in a car or bus; sitting at work; sitting to view television or mov- ies; sitting using a computer at home (e.g., checking e-mail, using the Internet, playing games); and doing other activities that involve sitting (e.g., eating meals, talking on the phone, reading, playing cards, or sewing). For all questions, partici- pants provided open-ended duration responses (hours and minutes). We evaluated the reliability and validity of the SCCS physical activity questionnaire in 118 randomly se- lected SCCS participants and found the validity of the instru- ment to be comparable for blacks and whites (21). Accumulating 1 MET-hour/day of energy ex- penditure from physical activity is achieved by participating in 0.5 hours of a light activity (2 METs per hour), 0.25 hours of moderate intensity activity (4 METs per hour), or 0.125 hours of a vigorous activity (8 METs per hour).",MET-hour/day,,"Overall Sedentary Behavior, slow and fast walking",905,hr,"Adjusted for sex, source of enrollment (community health center or general population), educational level (<9 years, 9–11 years, high school, some college, or beyond college), household income (<$15,000, $15,000–$24,999, $25,000–$49,999, or ?$50,000), cigarette smoking (never; former, <1 pack/day; former, ?1 pack/day; current, <1 pack/day; or current, ?1 pack/day), body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2; <18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, 30.0–34.9, or ?35.0), sleep duration (<7, 7–8, or ?9 hours/day), diabetes (yes or no), and employment status (yes or no) and adjusted for overall sedentary behavior (quartiles).",,,,328,70889.6,11077,1,,,,,,,,,Total participants 63308 and approximately 70% of cohort members were black.

In addition, we asked for the usual pace of walking and the number of  ?ights of stairs climbed daily. Based on the rate of energy expenditure required by these activities, we assigned a multiple of resting metabolic rate (MET score) to each group of activities and stair climbing [26]. Since resting metabolic rate is approximately 4.2 kJ/kg body weight per hour, we calculated the energy expended per week on each group of activities and stair climbing by multiplying the assigned MET score by 4.2, body weight and hours per week of participa- tion [27]. (We assumed a rate of 70 steps per minute to estimate the time spent in climbing stairs [28].) We then summed kilojoules per week from the eight groups of activities, plus stair climbing, to estimate the weekly energy expenditure on recreational activities for each woman.

In addition, we asked for the usual pace of walking and the number of  ?ights of stairs climbed daily. Based on the rate of energy expenditure required by these activities, we assigned a multiple of resting metabolic rate (MET score) to each group of activities and stair climbing [26]. Since resting metabolic rate is approximately 4.2 kJ/kg body weight per hour, we calculated the energy expended per week on each group of activities and stair climbing by multiplying the assigned MET score by 4.2, body weight and hours per week of participa- tion [27].

A total of 39,876 women free of heart disease, stroke and cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer) were randomized to active drug or placebo22. Follow-up surveys asking about treatment compliance, risk factors and endpoints of interest were mailed every six months during the first year and annually thereafter.
