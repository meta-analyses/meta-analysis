The high standards maintained by the CCR ensure that follow-up for cancer outcomes are virtually complete as long as cohort members reside in California. Linkage between the CTS cohort and the CCR database is based on full name, date of birth, address and social security number and includes manual review of possible matches. California and national mortality files were used to ascertain date and cause of death. Follow-up time was calculated as the number of days between the date of baseline questionnaire completion and the first occurrence of a first diagnosis of endometrial cancer. The end date of follow-up is defined as the date of endometrial cancer diagnosis, date of a move for 44 months out of California, date of death – or the end date of follow-up – whichever came first.","Participants provided detailed information on the baseline questionnaire regarding their recreational physical activity during various time periods in their lives. These time periods included: while in high school, between the ages of 18–24, 25–34, 35–44 and 45–54 years, and during the 3 years before completing the questionnaire, herein referred to as ‘baseline’ activity. For each time period, participants were asked to indicate the average amount of time spent participating in strenuous intensity physical activity (e.g., swimming laps, aerobics/calisthenics, running and jogging) and moderate-intensity activity (e.g., brisk walking, recreational tennis, golf, softball and volleyball). Participants reported the average number of hours per week (none, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4–6, 7–10, andX11 h per week) and average number of months per year (1–3, 4–6, 7–9 and 10–12 months per year) for each level of physical activity intensity in which they participated. For each time period and intensity level, the average annual hours per week was multiplied by months per year of participation and divided by total years to estimate average hours per week per year. The midpoint value of the hours per week and months per year categories was assigned, when appropriate, in making these calculations. A conservative value of 12 was assigned to the category X11 h per week. Long-term recreational physical activity was calculated by multiplying the average hours per week per year for each time period by the number of total years spent in that time period. These values were then summed across all time periods and divided by the total number of years.  Recent physical activity was calculated in a manner similar to that outlined for long-term activity, by calculating the average hours per week per year of strenuous and moderate physical activity for the 3 years prior to cohort enrolment (baseline).

Data on date and cause of death were obtained from the California state mortality files and the Social Security Administration death master file.,questionnaire,h/wk/y,"Participants provided detailed information on the baseline questionnaire regarding their recreational physical activities during a series of time periods in their lives (while in high school; between theagesof18and24,25and34,35and44,and45and54 years; as well as during the 3 years before completing the questionnaire). For each time period, they were asked to indicate the average amount of time spent participating in all moderate activities (examples given for this question include brisk walking, recreational tennis, volleyball, golf, softball, and cycling on level street) and in all strenuous activities (examples given include swimming laps, aerobics, calisthen- ics, running, jogging, cycling on hills, and racquetball). Participants reported the average number of hours per week (categories: none, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4-6, 7-10, and z11 h) and average number of months per year (categories: 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 months) they engaged in strenuous physical activities and in moderate physical activities. For each time period, we created separate ‘‘hours per week’’ variables for strenuous and moderate physical activity by multiplying the hours spent per week by the portion of the year in which the woman engaged in the activity. We assigned the midpoint value of the categories in making these calculations and assigned a value of 12 for the category z11 h/wk. We also summed the strenuous and moderate activity variables for each physical activity time/age period to create a third measure, ‘‘strenuous plus moderate activity.’’ Lifetime phys- ical activity was calculated for each participant by multiply- ing the average hours per week per year of activity done during a time period (high school and between the ages of 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, and 45-54 years) by the number of years the woman spent in the relevant time period and then summing across all time periods. We then divided this cumulative measure by the total number of years spent in all of the time periods. This provides an average annual lifetime (beginning with high school through current age if <55 years at baseline) or quasi-average annual lifetime (if 55 years or older at baseline) measure of physical activity for each woman.

The Nutrition Cohort is a subgroup of the CPS-II baseline mortality cohort (10). Participants of ages 50 to 74 years were enrolled in the study in 1992–93 when they completed a 10-page, self-administered ques- tionnaire on demographic, reproductive, medical, envi- ronmental, and behavioral factors. Beginning in 1997, follow-up questionnaires have been sent to participants every 2 years to update exposure information and to ascertain newly diagnosed cancers. Response rates among living cohort members are 88% or more.
Excluded from the analysis were 3,111 women lost to follow-up (i.e., alive at first follow-up but did not return any follow-up questionnaire), who reported prevalent cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) at enrollment (N 1?4 12,059), were pre/peri-menopausal (N 1?4 4,712), or missing information on recreational physical activity, sitting time, or BMI (N 1?4 4,222).

Beginning in 1997, follow-up questionnaires were sent to cohort members every 2 years to update exposure informa- tion and to ascertain newly diagnosed cancers. All follow-up ques- tionnaire response rates (after multiple mailings) among living cohort members are at least 88%. End of follow-up for the present analysis was June 30, 2003.
We excluded from this analysis 3,190 women who were lost to follow-up (i.e., alive at the first follow-up questionnaire in 1997 but did not return the 1997 or any subsequent follow-up question- naire), who reported prevalent cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) at baseline (N 5 12,053), who reported not being post- menopausal (N 5 4,291) or who had a hysterectomy or unknown hysterectomy status at baseline (N 5 30,724). We also excluded women with missing information on recreational physical activity at baseline (N 5 640) or BMI at baseline (N 5 756). To eliminate the strong effect of estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (ERT) on endometrial cancer and the possibility that reports of ERT only use were in error (because this regimen is contraindi- cated in women with an intact uterus), we excluded women who reported current ERT use in 1992 (N 5 1,583) and those with cur- rent or past postmenopausal hormone use of unknown type in 1992 (n 5 1,812). Finally, we excluded reported cases of endome- trial cancer that could not be verified through medical or cancer registry records (N 5 33) or cases with missing or potentially unrelated histologies such as endometrial stromal sarcoma (histol- ogy code 8930), adenosarcoma (code 8933), Mullerian mixed tumor (code 8950), endometrial adenofibroma (code 8381) and carcinosarcoma (code 8980) (n 5 32). The etiology of these less common tumors is thought to be different from endometrial carci- nomas. Women who did not return a 1999, 2001 or 2003 question- naire were censored at the return of their last questionnaire.

Lastly, 24 incident cases were initially identified as interval deaths (deaths that occurred between baseline in 1992 and the end of follow-up in 2003) through automated linkage of the entire cohort with the National Death Index,26 and subsequently verified through linkage with state cancer registries.","Baseline information on recreational physical activity was col- lected using the question ‘‘During the past year, what was the av- erage time per week you spent at the following kinds of activities: walking, jogging/running, lap swimming, tennis or racquetball, bicycling or stationary biking, aerobics/calisthenics and dancing?’’ Response to each activity included ‘‘none,’’ ‘‘1–3 hr per week,’’ ‘‘4–6 hr per week’’ or ‘‘71 hr per week.’’ Summary MET-hr/week were calculated for each participant. A MET, or metabolic equiva- lent, is the ratio of metabolic rate during a specific activity to rest- ing metabolic rate.27 Because of the older age of this population, the summary MET score for each participant was calculated by multiplying the lowest number of hours within each category times the moderate intensity MET score for each activity accord- ing to the Compendium of Physical Activities27 to provide conser- vatively estimated summary measures. The MET scores for vari- ous activities were27: 3.5 for walking, 7.0 for jogging/running, 7.0 for lap swimming, 6.0 for tennis or racquetball, 4.0 for bicycling/ stationary biking, 4.5 for aerobics/calisthenics and 3.5 for dancing. Recreational physical activity at baseline was categorized in MET-hr/week as none, >0–<7, 7–<17.5, 17.5–<31.5 or !31.5. For reference, 31.5 MET-hr/week corresponds to approximately 1 hr of moderate-paced walking (3.0 mph) per day.
In addition to recreational leisure activity at baseline, nonre- creational leisure activity was also examined based on information collected from the question ‘‘During the past year, what was the average time per week you spent at the following kinds of activ- ities: gardening/mowing/planting, heavy housework/vacuuming, heavy home repair/painting and shopping?’’ The above algorithm was used to calculate MET-hr/week using the following values for each activity27: 3.0 for gardening/mowing/planting, 2.5 for heavy housework/vacuuming, 3.0 for heavy home repair/painting and 2.5 for shopping. Baseline nonrecreational leisure activity was catego- rized in quartiles of MET-hr/week as none, >0–5.0, >5.0–<10.0, 10.0–<18.5 or !18.5.
For both recreational and nonrecreational physical activity, women who reported being inactive were not used as the referent group because of the possibility that their complete inactivity may be due to underlying conditions related in some way to endome- trial cancer risk. If inactive women suffer from other health con- ditions that are hormone-related and impair their ability to engage in physical activity (such as severe osteoporosis), the association between inactivity and endometrial cancer risk may be con- founded.",MET-hr/week,"Recreational physical activity at baseline was categorized in MET-hr/week as none, >0–<7, 7–<17.5, 17.5–<31.5 or !31.5.

EPIC Study,Friedenreich et al.,2007,33,Europe,Prospective cohort,Western European women,"In brief, standardized question- naire data on dietary and lifestyle factors were collected from ??370,000 women and 150,000 men, enrolled between 1992 and 2000 in 23 centres throughout 10 western European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, Swe- den, The Netherlands and United Kingdom).30 Participants were mainly between 35 and 70 years of age at enrolment, and were recruited from the general population residing within defined geo- graphic areas (i.e. town or province), with some exceptions: women who were members of a health insurance scheme for state school employees (France); women attending breast cancer screening (Utrecht, The Netherlands); blood donors (some centres in Italy and Spain) and a cohort of mainly vegetarians (Oxford O?health consciousO? cohort). Approval for this study was obtained from the ethical review boards of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and from all local recruiting institutions. All participants provided written informed consent.
For the present analysis, we excluded a priori the following women: 19,953 with prevalent cancer at enrolment, 1,293 with missing follow-up data, 35,444 with a hysterectomy at baseline, 6,091 participants who were in the top or bottom 1% of the distri- bution of the ratio of energy intake to estimated energy require- ment32 and 3,586 members with no dietary or lifestyle data. In addition, women with missing or nonstandardized physical activ- ity questionnaire data were excluded, comprising all study sub- jects from Norway (n 5 34,275) and Umea ?, Sweden (n 5 12,519), about 23% (n 5 2,661) of the participants in Bilthoven, The Netherlands and less than 1% in other centres.",253023,1,0.00,2,"2 rows: LTPA, TPA",50.80,10.3,,,,,,TPA,35-70,,,,,6.60,1.80,1625397.0,endometrial cancer,incidence,"Incident cases were identified through population-based cancer registries, except in France, Germany and Greece, where a combi- nation of methods, including health insurance records, cancer and pathology registries, and active follow-up through study subjects and their next-of-kin was used. Data on vital status in most EPIC study centres were collected from mortality registries at the re- gional or national level, in combination with data collected by active follow-up (Greece). Vital status was known for 98.4% of all EPIC participants as at April 2004. Women were followed from the date of enrolment until endometrial cancer diagnosis, death, emigration or end of the follow-up period. The closure date for this study period for each EPIC centre was the date of the last complete follow-up for both cancer incidence and vital status, which varied between December 1999 and March 2004 between EPIC centres. A total of 689 incident cases of endometrial cancer were diagnosed during the follow-up period. The cancer diagnosis was confirmed by histology for 88% of cases, by clinical examina- tion for 9% and the remaining 3% by either self-report, tomogra- phy scan, surgery, autopsy or by death certificate. Detailed mor- phology was specified for 226 (33%) cases, of which 207 (92%) were endometrioid, 8 (4%) serous, 5 (2%) mucinous, 4 (2%) clear cell and 2 (1%) undifferentiated.44","The assessment of physical activity has been previously described in detail.33 The EPIC physical activity questionnaire was derived from a longer, modified version of the Baecke ques- tionnaire,34 and was administered at study entry predominantly by self-administration.30,33 The stratification by study centre in this and other EPIC-analyses is considered to control for center effects related to different questionnaire design and follow-up procedures. In a study by Pols et al.,35 the Spearman correlation coefficients for the estimated reproducibility of the EPIC questionnaire over 5–11 months ranged from 0.49 to 0.81 in women, and for the rela- tive validity as assessed by 3-day activity diaries the correlation coefficients ranged from 0.28 to 0.72. They found the question- naire to be satisfactory for the ranking of subjects although less suitable for the estimation of energy expenditure.
Data on current occupational activity included employment sta- tus and the level of physical activity done at work (nonworker, sedentary, standing, manual, heavy manual and unknown). Partici- pants were also asked to report the frequency and duration of rec- reational and household activities, in summer and winter, during a typical week in the past year. Household activities included house- work, home repair, gardening and stair climbing. Recreational activities included walking, cycling and sports activities. The overall level of recreational and household activity was calculated in MET-hours/week, by summing the metabolic equivalent inten- sity values (METs)36 that were assigned to reported hours per week of recreational and household activities. The assigned MET values were 3.0 for walking, 6.0 for cycling, 4.0 for gardening, 6.0 for sports, 4.5 for home repair (do-it-yourself work), 3.0 for house- work and 8.0 for stair climbing, obtained by estimating the aver- age of all comparable activities in the compendium of physical activities.36 In addition, the frequency and duration of vigorous nonoccupational activity, defined as activities causing sweating or faster heartbeat, was collected.",,"A physical activity index based on occupational activity, cy- cling and sports has been previously developed by Wareham et al., and validated using heart rate monitoring and cardiorespira- tory fitness tests.37 However, low- and moderate- intensity activ- ities such as walking and household activities are the most accessi- ble and popular forms of physical activity,38 and have been associ- ated with lower rates of breast cancer39 and other chronic diseases.38,40 Therefore, to make the index more comprehensive, we derived an index of total physical activity (inactive, moder- ately inactive, moderately active, active), that was estimated by cross-tabulation of the level of occupational activity (nonworker, sedentary, standing, manual, heavy manual and unknown) with combined recreational and household activities (in quartiles of MET-hours/week) (Appendix Table AI). As a means of indirectly assessing the validity of the total physical activity index, we com- pared the total physical activity index with estimates of the ratio of energy intake (EI), collected using EPIC dietary questionnaires, to predicted basal metabolic rate (BMR)41 adjusted for age and centre and within different BMI categories. We found a positive relation between EI/BMR and total activity level, both overall and among women in different BMI subgroups, indicating that this index appropriately ranked the subjects according to their pre- dicted energy requirements (Fig. 1).",Occupational activity; Household activity; Recreational activity,,,Inactive,Moderately inactive,Moderately active,Active,,,,,,,49.50,58.10,126.90,145.20,,,,,,,39.32,46.71,111.67,130.71,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,671,103,267,257,44,,,,,,,261857,643979,597784,121777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hr,"Stratified by age and centre, and adjusted for BMI, age at menarche, menopausal status, age at menopause, age at birth of last child, ever use of oral contraceptives, ever use of hormone replacement therapy, education, smoking status, hypertension, dia- betes, fruit and vegetable intake, fibre intake, carbohydrate intake, energy intake.",1.00,,,0.83,0.66,1.06,0.83,0.65,1.07,0.88,0.61,1.27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Stratified by age and centre,1,,,0.84,0.67,1.07,0.83,0.64,1.06,0.85,0.59,1.23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Totals exclude 18 cases and 6,439 noncases where the occu- pational activity is unknown.

EPIC Study,Friedenreich et al.,2007,33,Europe,Prospective cohort,Western European women,"In brief, standardized question- naire data on dietary and lifestyle factors were collected from ??370,000 women and 150,000 men, enrolled between 1992 and 2000 in 23 centres throughout 10 western European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, Swe- den, The Netherlands and United Kingdom).30 Participants were mainly between 35 and 70 years of age at enrolment, and were recruited from the general population residing within defined geo- graphic areas (i.e. town or province), with some exceptions: women who were members of a health insurance scheme for state school employees (France); women attending breast cancer screening (Utrecht, The Netherlands); blood donors (some centres in Italy and Spain) and a cohort of mainly vegetarians (Oxford O?health consciousO? cohort). Approval for this study was obtained from the ethical review boards of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and from all local recruiting institutions. All participants provided written informed consent.
For the present analysis, we excluded a priori the following women: 19,953 with prevalent cancer at enrolment, 1,293 with missing follow-up data, 35,444 with a hysterectomy at baseline, 6,091 participants who were in the top or bottom 1% of the distri- bution of the ratio of energy intake to estimated energy require- ment32 and 3,586 members with no dietary or lifestyle data.

Data on vital status in most EPIC study centres were collected from mortality registries at the re- gional or national level, in combination with data collected by active follow-up (Greece). Vital status was known for 98.4% of all EPIC participants as at April 2004. Women were followed from the date of enrolment until endometrial cancer diagnosis, death, emigration or end of the follow-up period. The closure date for this study period for each EPIC centre was the date of the last complete follow-up for both cancer incidence and vital status, which varied between December 1999 and March 2004 between EPIC centres. A total of 689 incident cases of endometrial cancer were diagnosed during the follow-up period. The cancer diagnosis was confirmed by histology for 88% of cases, by clinical examina- tion for 9% and the remaining 3% by either self-report, tomogra- phy scan, surgery, autopsy or by death certificate. Detailed mor- phology was specified for 226 (33%) cases, of which 207 (92%) were endometrioid, 8 (4%) serous, 5 (2%) mucinous, 4 (2%) clear cell and 2 (1%) undifferentiated.44","The assessment of physical activity has been previously described in detail.33 The EPIC physical activity questionnaire was derived from a longer, modified version of the Baecke ques- tionnaire,34 and was administered at study entry predominantly by self-administration.30,33 The stratification by study centre in this and other EPIC-analyses is considered to control for center effects related to different questionnaire design and follow-up procedures. In a study by Pols et al.,35 the Spearman correlation coefficients for the estimated reproducibility of the EPIC questionnaire over 5–11 months ranged from 0.49 to 0.81 in women, and for the rela- tive validity as assessed by 3-day activity diaries the correlation coefficients ranged from 0.28 to 0.72. They found the question- naire to be satisfactory for the ranking of subjects although less suitable for the estimation of energy expenditure.
Data on current occupational activity included employment sta- tus and the level of physical activity done at work (nonworker, sedentary, standing, manual, heavy manual and unknown). Partici- pants were also asked to report the frequency and duration of rec- reational and household activities, in summer and winter, during a typical week in the past year.

Active follow-up of study participants and next-of-kin, as well as of social security records, and cancer and pathology registries was used in France, Germany and Greece. For centers using active follow-up, end of follow-up was the last known contact, date of diagnosis, or date of death. Mortality data were coded according to the 10th Revi- sion of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD-10) and cancer incidence data were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-2). ","A description of the physical activity ascertainment, validity and reproducibility used in the EPIC study has been pub- lished in detail elsewhere.28–30 Physical activity data were obtained either by face-to-face interviews (Germany, Greece, Spain) or were self-administered (Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and UK) using a standardized questionnaire in all centers included in this analysis. Data on current occupa- tional activity included employment status and the level of physical activity done at work (nonworker, sedentary, stand- ing, manual, heavy manual and unknown). Housewives were categorized as nonworkers. In the Danish centers, the ques- tionnaire focused on type of work activity done within the last year, and participants who did not answer this question were categorized as nonworking.
The number of hours per week of nonoccupational physi- cal activities during the past year were collected in all centers and was comprised household activities, including house- work, home repair (do-it-yourself activities), gardening and stair climbing, and recreational activities including walking, cycling and sports combined as done in winter and summer separately. Since the intensity of recreational and household activities was not directly recorded, a metabolic equivalent (MET) value was assigned to each reported activity according to the Compendium of Physical Activities.31 A MET is defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to a standard metabolic rate of 1.0 kcal (4.184 kJ)/kg/hr, one MET is considered a resting metabolic rate obtained during quiet sitting. The MET values assigned to the nonoccupational data were: 3.0 for walking, 6.0 for cycling, 4.0 for gardening, 6.0 for sports, 4.5 for home repair (do-it-yourself work), 3.0 for housework and 8.0 for stair climbing. These mean MET values were obtained by estimating the average of all comparable activ- ities in the Compendium. The mean number of hours per week of summer and winter household and recreational activities were estimated and then multiplied by the appropri- ate MET values to obtain MET-hours/week of activity.
Housework (including child and older adult care), home repair, gardening, and stair climbing were combined to obtain an overall estimate of household activity. Walking (including walking to work, shopping and leisure time), cycling (including cycling to work, shopping and leisure time) and sports activities were combined to derive overall recreational physical activity. Household and recreational activities in MET-hours/week were combined and cohort par- ticipants classified according to EPIC-wide quartiles of total nonoccupational physical activity.
Two indices of total physical activity, combining occupa- tional and non-occupational activities, have been developed pre- viously. Both indices categorize individuals into inactive, moder- ately inactive, moderately active and active groups.

Further, we excluded the study centers Malmo (Swe- den), Granada and Murcia (Spain) (n 1?4 26,091) as for these subcohorts receptor information could not be provided, and we also excluded women with missing nondietary question- naire data or missing or nonstandardized physical activity questionnaire data, comprising the full Norwegian subcohort (n 1?4 35,890) and the Umea? center (Sweden, n 1?4 12,513).",257805,1,0.00,2,"2 rows: LTPA, TPA",51.30,,,,,,,TPA,35 - 70,Total,"menopausal status (premenopausal, perimenopausal, postmenopausal), age at menopause (<43, 43–46, 47–49, 50–51, 52–53, ??54, missing).

For these centers, follow-up was completed as fol- lows: December 2004 (Asturias), December 2006 (Florence, Varese, Ragusa, Naples and San Sebastian), December 2007 (Navarra, Oxford, Bilthoven, Aarhus and Copenhagen), Janu- ary 2008 (Utrecht), June 2008 (Cambridge) and December 2008 (Turin). Active follow-up of study participants and next-of-kin, as well as of social security records, and cancer and pathology registries was used in France, Germany and Greece. For centers using active follow-up, end of follow-up was the last known contact, date of diagnosis, or date of death. Mortality data were coded according to the 10th Revi- sion of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD-10) and cancer incidence data were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-2). ","A description of the physical activity ascertainment, validity and reproducibility used in the EPIC study has been pub- lished in detail elsewhere.28–30 Physical activity data were obtained either by face-to-face interviews (Germany, Greece, Spain) or were self-administered (Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and UK) using a standardized questionnaire in all centers included in this analysis. Data on current occupa- tional activity included employment status and the level of physical activity done at work (nonworker, sedentary, stand- ing, manual, heavy manual and unknown). Housewives were categorized as nonworkers. In the Danish centers, the ques- tionnaire focused on type of work activity done within the last year, and participants who did not answer this question were categorized as nonworking.
The number of hours per week of nonoccupational physi- cal activities during the past year were collected in all centers and was comprised household activities, including house- work, home repair (do-it-yourself activities), gardening and stair climbing, and recreational activities including walking, cycling and sports combined as done in winter and summer separately. Since the intensity of recreational and household activities was not directly recorded, a metabolic equivalent (MET) value was assigned to each reported activity according to the Compendium of Physical Activities.31 A MET is defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to a standard metabolic rate of 1.0 kcal (4.184 kJ)/kg/hr, one MET is considered a resting metabolic rate obtained during quiet sitting. The MET values assigned to the nonoccupational data were: 3.0 for walking, 6.0 for cycling, 4.0 for gardening, 6.0 for sports, 4.5 for home repair (do-it-yourself work), 3.0 for housework and 8.0 for stair climbing. These mean MET values were obtained by estimating the average of all comparable activ- ities in the Compendium. The mean number of hours per week of summer and winter household and recreational activities were estimated and then multiplied by the appropri- ate MET values to obtain MET-hours/week of activity.
Housework (including child and older adult care), home repair, gardening, and stair climbing were combined to obtain an overall estimate of household activity. Walking (including walking to work, shopping and leisure time), cycling (including cycling to work, shopping and leisure time) and sports activities were combined to derive overall recreational physical activity. Household and recreational activities in MET-hours/week were combined and cohort par- ticipants classified according to EPIC-wide quartiles of total nonoccupational physical activity.
Two indices of total physical activity, combining occupa- tional and non-occupational activities, have been developed pre- viously. Both indices categorize individuals into inactive, moder- ately inactive, moderately active and active groups. The ‘‘Cambridge index’’ cross-classifies occupational activity with hours spent doing cycling and sports.30,32 The second index, the ‘‘total physical activity index’’, cross-classifies all household and recreational activity combined with occupational activity.29,3",,Cambridge Index - Wareham,"Recreational activity, Occupational activity, Household activity, Combined recreational and household activities, Cambridge physical activity index",,,Inactive,Moderately inactive,Moderately active,Active,,,,,,,0.00,9.97,20.04,33.40,,,,,,,0.00,8.22,14.79,24.65,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8034,1756,2949,2006,1323,,,,,,,437567,1032566,1074431,237803,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hr,"Stratified by age and center and adjusted for body mass index, age at first period, age at first full term pregnancy, number of full term pregnancies, breast feeding, ever OC pill, menopausal status, age at menopause, use of hormone replacement therapy, alcohol consumption, smoking status, level of school attained; mutually adjusted for other types of physical activity if applicable, 2p for trend based on the mean value within each quartile category.",1.00,,,0.96,0.90,1.02,0.93,0.87,1.00,0.94,0.87,1.01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Results by age at diagnosis.

three categories: (i) ‘low’was physically very easy, sitting
office work, e.g. secretary; (ii) ‘moderate’ was work including
standing and walking, e.g. store assistant, light industrial
worker; (iii) ‘high’ was work including walking and lifting,
or heavy manual labor, e.g. industrial or farm work. Daily
commuting return journey was categorized into three categories:
(i) motorized transportation or nowork (nowalking or
cycling); (ii)walking or bicycling 1–29 min/day; (iii)walking
or bicycling more than 30 min/day. Self-reported leisure-time
physical activity was classified into three categories: (i) ‘low’
was defined as almost completely inactive, such as reading,
watchingTV, or doing some minor physical activity but not of
moderate or high level; (ii) ‘moderate’ was doing some physical
activity more than 4 h a week, such as walking, cycling,
or light gardening, excluding travel to work; (iii) ‘high’ was
performing vigorous physical activity more than 3 h a week, such as running, jogging, swimming, or heavy gardening, or
competitive sports several times a week.",,,,Low ,Moderate,high ,,,,,,,,0.00,15.00,36.00,,,,,,,,0.00,9.00,31.50,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1587,877,622,88,,,,,,,,197817,230029,59751,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hr,age and study-year adjusted,1.00,,,0.76,0.69,0.84,0.77,0.62,0.96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adjusted for age, study year, education, alcohol consumption, and smoking status, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, and history of diabetes, Also adjusted for occupational and commuting physical activity.",1,,,0.85,0.77,0.95,0.77,0.62,0.96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Less adjusted models also included (i.e. without BMI). **Commuting PA domain also reported,,,,,,,

detailed description of the questions has been presented
elsewhere (9–12). The questionnaire used for the assessment
of physical activity has been used successfully elsewhere,
and it has shown a high correlation with physical
fitness, as measured by maximal oxygen uptake (13,14). The
subjects reported their occupational physical activity according
to the following 3 categories: 1) low was defined as
physically very easy, sitting office work (e.g., secretary); 2)
moderate was defined as work including standing and
walking (e.g., store assistant, light industrial worker); and 3)
high was defined as work including walking and lifting or
heavy manual labor (e.g., industrial or farm work). Daily
commuting (return journey) was divided into 3 categories:
1) motorized transportation or no physical work (no walking
or cycling); 2) walking or bicycling 1 to 29 min/day; and 3)
walking or bicycling more than 30 min/day. Self-reported
leisure-time physical activity was divided into 3 categories:
1) low was defined as almost completely inactive, such as
reading, watching TV, or doing some minor physical
activity, but not of moderate or high level; 2) moderate was
doing some physical activity more than 4 h/week, such as
walking, cycling, or light gardening, excluding travel to

For each sport or recreation listed, we asked about frequency (weeks per year) and duration (time per week when active). This assessment of physical activity has been shown to be reliable and valid in large population studies for ranking individuals according to their physical activity. Using the information provided, we estimated total energy expended per week in physical activity. Walking one block daily rated 235 kJ/week; climbing one flight of stairs daily required 118 kJ/week. To each sport or recreation, we assigned a multiple of resting metabolic rate (MET score). Since resting metabolic rate is approximately 4.2 kJ/kg body weight/hour, we estimated the average weekly expenditure for that activity by multiplying its MET score by 4.2, body weight, and hours per year of participation, then dividng by 52.

of interest in whether nonvigorous and vigorous activities have
equivalent benefits,36 we calculated separately energy expenditure
from nonvigorous (,6 METs) and vigorous ($6 METs) sports or
recreation.35 (Examples of vigorous activities reported by alumni
include jogging or running, swimming laps, playing tennis, and
shoveling snow.) For nonvigorous energy expenditure, we defined 5
categories: none (51.1% of men), 1 to ,250 (13.8%), 250 to ,600
(11.7%), 600 to ,1400 (12.0%), and $1400 kcal/wk (11.4%). For
vigorous energy expenditure, we did likewise (41.0%, 16.9%,
12.1%, 14.7%, and 15.3%, respectively). These cut points were
chosen so that among those who did report some sport or recreation,
men would be approximately evenly distributed among the remaining
4 categories of energy expenditure. Furthermore, the choice of
identical cut points would enable direct comparison of stroke rates
between, for example, men who expended 250 to ,600 kcal/wk in
nonvigorous activities and those who expended the same amount of
energy but in vigorous activities. With the growing recognition that it is difficult to persuade the many
sedentary individuals25 to take up vigorous activities, research interest
lately has focused on moderate intensity physical activity.37 Therefore,
we analyzed physical activity in a third way. We calculated the energy
expended on sports or recreation separately for light activities (,4.5
METs) and for activities of at least moderate intensity ($4.5 METs).
(Examples of moderate activities reported by alumni include dancing,
bicycling, snorkeling, and digging or filling in garden.) We used the same cut points as before in analyses. For light energy expenditure, men
distributed themselves thus: none, 63.9%; 1 to ,250, 10.3%; 250 to
,600, 8.2%; 600 to ,1400, 8.7%; and $1400 kcal/wk, 8.9%. For

Walking pace, categorized as casual (<2 miles/hour), normal (2–2.9 miles/hour), brisk (3–3.9 miles/hour), or striding (?4 miles/hour), was also assessed. A metabolic equivalent task (MET) score was assigned to each activity based on its energy cost (1). To calculate the amount of energy expended, the time spent at each activity in hours per week was multiplied by its MET score then summed over all activities to yield total MET-hours/week. Vigorous activities, defined as requiring MET values ? 6, were jogging (>10 minutes/mile), running (?10 minutes/mile), bicycling, swimming, tennis, squash or racquetball, and rowing. Moderate activities (3 ? METs < 6) were brisk walking, heavy outdoor work, and weight training.

Deaths were reported by next of kin,
work associates, and postal authorities.
In case of persistent nonresponse,
the National Death Index was used to
identify deceased cohort members. Fatal
CHD was confirmed by reviewing
medical records or autopsy reports with
the permission of the next of kin. The
cause listed on the death certificate was
not sufficient alone to confirm a coronary
death. Sudden deaths (ie, deaths
within 1 hour of symptom onset in men
without known disease that could explain
death) were included in the fatal
CHD category. For subjects with multiple
end points, follow-up ended with
onset of the first event.","Leisure-time physical activity was
assessed every 2 years between 1986 and
1996, using the question: “During the
past year what was your average time per
week spent at each activity?” The average
weekly time spent on walking or
hiking outdoors, jogging ( 6mph),running
( 6 mph), bicycling, lap swimming,
tennis, squash or racquetball, calisthenics,
or rowing was recorded
beginning in 1986. Heavy outdoor work
was added in 1988 and weight training
in 1990. Walking pace, categorized as
casual ( 2 mph), normal (2-2.9 mph),
brisk (3-3.9 mph), or striding ( 4mph),
wasalso recorded.Thetime spent at each
activity in hours per week was multiplied
by its typical energy expenditure,
expressed in metabolic equivalent tasks
(METs),4 then summed over all activities,
to yield a MET-hour score. One
MET,the energyexpendedbysitting quietly,
is equivalent to 3.5 mL of oxygen
uptake per kilogram of body weight per
minute, or to 1 kcal/kg of body weight
per hour. Vigorous activities were
defined as those requiring 6 METs or
more: jogging, running, bicycling, lap
swimming, tennis, squash or racquetball,
and rowing. Nonvigorous activities
( 6 METs) include walking, heavy
outdoor work, and weight training.
We created a measure of average exercise
intensity for each individual by
dividing the total weekly volume of exercise
in MET-hours by the total weekly
hours spent in physical activity.
The validity and reproducibility of the
physical activity questionnaire were assessed
in 1991 when 238 participants in
theHPFScompleted a 1-week activity diary
at 4 periods corresponding to different
seasons throughout a year.5 The questionnaire
showed good time integration
when levels of activity were compared
with the average of the 4 single-week
physical activity diaries administered
during the 4 seasons. The correlation between
scores of physical activity from the
diaries and from the questionnaire was
0.65 for total physical activity and 0.58
for vigorous activity. The correlation
between questionnaire-derived vigorous
activity and resting pulse rate was
–0.45; the correlation between vigorous
activity and pulse rate after a selfadministered
step test was ?0.41.5 In a
subsample of participants in the HPFS
(n=466), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels increased by 2.4 mg/dL
(0.06 mmol/L) for each increment of 20

The first question, used by the Gallup Poll (21), asked ‘‘Aside from any work you do at home or at a job, do you do anything regularly—that is on a daily basis—that helps you keep physically fit?’’ This question was used to determine whether or not participants were involved in regular physical activity. Participants were then asked ‘‘How often, in your free time, do you take part in moderate physical activity (such as bowling, golf, light sports or physical exercise, gardening, taking long walks)?’’ and ‘‘How often, in your free time, do you take part in vigorous physical activity (such as jogging, racquet sports, swimming, aerobics, strenuous sports)?’’ Response options for these two questions included; more than four times a week, two to four times a week, about once a week, a few times a month, a few times a year, and rarely or never. Three levels of physical activity were derived from these two questions. Women were given a ‘‘high’’ physical activity level score if they participated in vigorous activity two or more times a week or participated in moderate activity more than four times per week. Women were given a ‘‘medium’’ physical activity level score if they participated in vigorous activity once a week or participated in moderate activity one to four times a week.

conducted a systematic review of death certificates,
all of which were forwarded to the local public health center
in each community. It is believed all deaths that occurred in
the cohort were ascertained, except for subjects who died
after they had moved from their original community, in
which case the subject was treated as a censored case.
Mortality data were sent centrally to the Ministry of Health
and Welfare, and the underling causes of death were coded
for the National Vital Statistics according to the International
Classification of Disease, 10th revision. The mortality
follow-up inquiry for this study was conducted until the end
of 1999, and the average follow-up was 9.7 years. Only 3.4%
of the subjects had moved out of the communities and were treated as censored.",Questionnaire,h/wk,"participants provided a valid response to questions about the
average daily time spent walking: “How long on average do
you spend walking indoors or outside on a daily basis?” The

and “ 1.0 h.” Subjects were also questioned about the
average weekly time spent in athletic and sporting events:

Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective study,Suzuki et al.,2011,64,Japan,prospective cohort,cohort I & II - all Japanese residents aged 40-69 years enrolled in the residential registries of 11 public health centers,"Two cohorts were enrolled (cohort I, Iwate-Ninohe, Akita-Yokote, Nagano-Saku, Okinawa-Chubu, and Tokyo-Kastushika; and cohort II, Ibaraki-Mito, Niigata- Nagaoka, Kochi-Chuohigashi, Nagasaki-Kamigoto, Okinawa-Miyako, and Osaka-Suita). Initially, 71,698 women were invited. Kastushika (cohort I) could not be included due to a lack of information on cancer incidence (n=4,178). We excluded women who did not possess Japanese nationality, moved before the start of follow-up, were not aged 40–69 years, or who had duplicate data (n=146).
Of the remainder, 55,838 completed the baseline questionnaires (response rate 83%). All eligible subjects were sent 5-year (1995–1998; response rate 80%) and 10-year follow-up questionnaires (2000–2003; response rate 78%). We excluded women with a self-reported history of cancer before the start of follow-up (n=1,509). To investigate the impact of leisure-time physical activity (LPA) on breast cancer risk, we excluded women with missing information on LPA (n=751). Age–area-adjusted analysis was conducted in 53,578 women.
Further, we then excluded women who had missing or unreliable information on height, BMI, BMI at age 20years (b14 or ?40), alcohol intake, smoking, or use of exogenous female hormones (EFH) (n = 13,804), as well as those with a family history of breast cancer (n=210) and women who reported unreasonable estimates of total energy intake (±3SD) (n=395). Finally, 39,169 women were included in multivariable-adjusted analysis. ",53578,1,0.00,2,"3 rows: total, pre, post-men.

Cases were defined as codes C500—509 (World Health Organization, 2000). Diagnosis was microscopically verified for 97% of all case patients. ER/PR status was evaluated by either immunohistochemical assay or enzyme-linked immunoassay. The cut-off point for positive receptor status was defined by clinical estimation at the treating hospital or by the assay method of the clinical laboratory. In most but not all cases, hormone receptor-positivity was defined as the presence of ?10fmol/mg protein in enzyme-linked immunoassay or by the finding of any positive cells in a specimen in immunohistochemical assay.",questionnaire,frequency,"The main exposure of interest was participation frequency in LPA. We inquired about the frequency of participation in non-occupational LPA, such as sports and exercise, at the baseline and 5-year follow-up surveys. In both questionnaires, we asked ‘How many times did you participate in sports and PA other than during working hours,’ with five predefined categories of almost never exercise: 1–3 days per month, 1–2 days per week, 3–4 days per week, and almost daily. In cohort II, we evaluated the impact of DTPA on breast cancer risk. DTPA was measured as metabolic equivalents (METs-hours/day). Calculation in METs has been explained elsewhere (Inoue et al., 2008). The same methods were used in the baseline and 5-year follow-up surveys because they contained common questions on sleeping time, heavy physical work or strenuous exercise, standing or walking time, and sitting time.

The current analyses included adults 20–89 years. Per the Adult Treat- ment Panel (ATP) definition, individuals were considered to be adults if they were at least 20 years old [13]. NHANES par- ticipants 89+ years were assigned an arbitrary age of 90 years for confidentiality purposes and were excluded from the ana- lyses.

Additionally, persons with missing values for the pertinent variables were also excluded.

Mortality information was obtained from the updated NHANES III Linked Mortal- ity Files that provide mortality follow-up data from the date of participation in the survey (1988–1994) through Decem- ber 31, 2006 (Figure 1). Mortality was ascertained based upon either death certificates or from a probabilistic match between NHANES III and the National Center for Health Statistics, National Death Index (NDI) records. Cancer mortality was identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10; NCHS 2006; ICD-10 codes C00–C97). Persons were considered alive at the end of the follow-up period if they were not matched to a death record. Details of the mortality files are described elsewhere [22].","Leisure-Time Physical Activity. A question- naire consisting leisure-time physical activity questions including type of activity and frequency of the activity in the past month was queried in the Household Adult Ques tionnaire administered once at baseline. There was no additional follow-up information on physical activity and other variables after time of entry into the study until the end of mortality follow-up (Figure 1). At baseline, participants were asked for example, if “In the past month, did you run or jog?” and “In the past month, how often did you jog or run?” Similarly, questions were asked on walking, bicycling, swimming, aerobics and/or aerobic dancing, other dancing, calisthenics, yard work, lifting weights, and engagement in up to four other activities that were not mentioned in the survey. Frequency of engagement in activities over the past 30 days was reported. These responses were standardized to weekly frequency by using the conversion factors of 4.3 weeks/month and 30.4 days/month per NHANES III [15]. A validated intensity rating in metabolic equivalents (MET) was provided by NHANES III for each activity as defined in the Compendium of Physical Activities [16]. For exam- ple, jogging/running was assigned an intensity rating of “8 METS.” For this study, LTPA was classified as “low inten- sity,” “moderate” and “vigorous” using the standard cut-offs established by Pate et al. [17]. Activities requiring <3 METS were classified as “low-intensity,” activities requiring 3– 6 METS were classified as “moderate” and >6 METS were classified as “vigorous” [17]. Participants who did not re- port engagement in any of the activities, were classified as “inactive.” Because individuals engaging in “low intensity” activities represented <0.05% (n = 7) of the population, they were combined into the “moderate” activity group.
Next, participants were categorized as performing “reg- ular low-to-moderate” exercises if they reported performing the activity at least 5 times per week and “regular vigorous” if they reported performing vigorous activities at least 3 times per week. These categories were mutually exclusive (so that if an individual performed vigorous and low-to-moderate activities, he/she was included in the vigorous activity group and not in both groups). Additionally, a frequency-weighted LTPA variable was calculated by multiplying the frequency of each activity by its corresponding intensity value and summed. This variable was divided into quartiles in the regression models. The NHANES III survey did not collect information for duration of each bout of exercise, which limits more precise estimation of physical activity. The phy- sical activity definitions used in this study are consistent with previously published studies using the NHANES III popula- tion .",METS/week,Quartiles,,,,<1.16,1.16-10.47,10.48-32,>48.33,,,,,,,0.58,5.82,21.24,67.25,,,,,,,0.43,4.34,16.21,54.74,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,733,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,hr,"Adjusted for age, race, sex, smoking",1.00,,,0.95,0.73,1.24,0.87,0.65,1.15,1.06,0.79,1.41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Analysis including persons with existing cancer.,,,,,,,

The physical activity questions on the subse- quent RFQ (1996–1997) predominantly assessed recreational and leisure time activities performed in the last 10 years. Examples of activities include tennis, golf, biking, swimming, heavy gardening, fast walking or dancing, aerobics and jog- ging. Participants reported categorical duration of activities (never, rarely, <1 hr/week, 1–3 hr/week, 4–7 hr/week and >7 hr/week).

NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study,Gierach et al.,2009,80,US,Prospective cohort,Women members of American Association of Retired Persons aged 50–71 years,"The study was initiated in 1995–1996 when a questionnaire was mailed to 3.5 million members of the AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons), ages 50–71 years, who resided in one of eight US states (CA, FL, PA, NJ, NC, LA, GA, and MI).  In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to the baseline questionnaire respondents to collect additional information on physical activity, menopausal HT use, medical history, and history of cancer. After excluding individuals who died (n=261) or moved out of the cancer registry ascertainment area (n=321) before their baseline questionnaire was received and scanned, proxy respondents to the baseline questionnaire (n=15,760), six individuals who withdrew from the study, and 325,174 men. In our analysis of baseline physical activity data, we excluded 23,911 women who reported a personal cancer history other than non-melanoma skin cancer, 82,132 who reported a prior hysterectomy, and 2,934 women with unknown hysterectomy status. We also excluded women who reported at baseline that their menstrual periods stopped due to surgery (n=1,829) or because of radiation or chemotherapy (n=117), 76 who developed non- epithelial endometrial cancer during follow-up, 8 with no follow-up, 421 (including 4 cases) who were missing baseline information on both daily routine and vigorous activity, and women with missing (n=3,530, including 31 cases) or extreme (defined as > two interquartile ranges from the mean; n=889, including 33 cases) values for baseline BMI (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters).",109621,1,0.00,2,1 row,,,,,,,,LTPA,50 - 71,,,,,,,760852.6,endometrial cancer,incidence,"Incident endometrial cancers were initially identified through probabilistic linkage to eight state cancer registries using first and last name, address, sex, date of birth, and Social Security Number. The cancer registry ascertainment area was recently expanded to include three additional states (TX, AZ, and NV) to capture cancer occurring among participants who moved to those states during follow-up. Histology was defined using International Classification of Diseases for Oncology codes, 3rd edition.31 A previous validation study in this cohort estimated that registry linkage validly identified approximately 90% of all incident cancers.","The baseline questionnaire captured several measures of physical activity. Participants were asked to select a response that best described their current daily routine activity, excluding exercise or sports: sit without walking very much; sit but walk fair amount; stand or walk a lot without carrying or lifting things; lift or carry light loads or climb stairs/hills often; or do heavy work or carry heavy loads. Participants were asked to indicate their frequency of vigorous physical activity during a typical month in the past 12 months: never, rarely, 1–3 times per month, 1–2 times per week, 3–4 times per week, or ? 5 times per week. Vigorous activity was defined as physical activity at work or home including exercise, sports, and carrying heavy loads that lasted ? 20 minutes and caused increases in breathing, heart rate, or sweating. Using the same response categories, participants were also asked to recall their frequency of participation in physical activities or sports during a typical month around the ages of 15–18 years old. We collapsed the never and rarely response categories for analysis.
The second questionnaire asked about several domains of physical activity: occupational, recreational and household, and physical inactivity. History of occupational physical activity was assessed by asking participants if they ever had a job requiring physically demanding work. Those responding affirmatively were asked to report the number of (none, 1–2, 3–5, or ? 6 jobs) and total number of years spent (none or <1 year, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or ? 10 years) in these jobs. The second questionnaire also assessed whether participants ever had a job in which they walked or biked to work for most days of the week and if so, the total number of years they did so (none, <1 year, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or ? 10 years). We combined the none and <1 year response categories for analysis.
Participants were instructed not to include occupational physical activity when reporting how often they participated in “light” and “moderate and vigorous” recreational and household activities. They could choose from the following options: never, rarely, weekly but <1 hour per week, 1–3 hours per week, 4–7 hours per week, and >7 hours per week. Participants were asked to read lists of examples of “light” and “moderate and vigorous” recreational and household activities and to select the option that best described how often they participated during various ages and time periods: 15–18, 19–29, and 35–39 years old, and in the past 10 years. The never and rarely response categories were collapsed for analysis. Since these physical activity questions captured frequency and dose, we calculated hours exercised per week and metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week using the Compendium of Physical Activities as a guide.30 First, midpoint values were used for each category of reported frequency/dose of participation in weekly activity: never/rarely was assigned a value of 0 hours; <1 hour per week was assigned a value of 0.5 hours; 1–3 hours per week was assigned a value of 2 hours; 4–7 hours per week was assigned a value of 5.5 hours; and >7 hours per week was assigned a value of 8 hours. MET values were then assigned to each level of activity: light activities, 3.0 MET; and moderate/vigorous activities, 7.0 MET. These MET values were multiplied by the values of activity hours per week and summed across the activity levels to determine MET-hours per week for each of the various ages and time periods.
Information on physical inactivity was based on two questions. Participants were asked about time spent watching TV or videos during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months. Time spent watching TV or videos was categorized as none, <1 hour, 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and ? 9 hours. In a separate question, participants were also asked to indicate the number of hours spent sitting during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months: <3, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and ? 9 hours. Both measures of inactivity were collapsed as <3, 3–4, 5–6, and ? 7 hours per day.",frequency (of at least 20 mins of vigorous activity),,"Current daily routine activity at work or home; Frequency of participation in physical activities or sports during typical month between ages 15–18 years

Respon- dents were members of AARP between the ages of 50–71 years old at baseline and residing in one of eight study areas (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, and metropolitan Atlanta and Detroit). In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to respondents who did not have self-reported prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer at baseline to collect more detailed information on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Among baseline questionnaire respondents, we excluded 179 duplicate questionnaires, 15,760 individuals whose questionnaires were completed by proxies for the intended respondents, 582 persons who died or moved out of the study area before study entry, and 6 people who withdrew from the study. We also excluded 51,193 persons with a previous cancer diagnosis, 997 persons reporting end-stage renal disease, 5,711 subjects with missing information on physical activity, and 4,021 persons who were statistical outliers on reported energy intake.

For matching purposes, we have virtually complete data on first and last name, address history, gender, and date of birth. All suspected matches underwent a process that rejects those with insufficient degree of similarity to confirm a true match (approximately 4%); uncertain matches underwent final manual review. We conducted a validation study of cancer endpoint ascertainment by linking a subset of our cohort (n = 12,000) to the cancer registries and comparing the data to self-reports and subsequent medical record confirmation of incident cancer in this sub-cohort. We found that approximately 90% of all incident cancers were accurately identified using the registries included in this cohort as the gold standard [42]. We used the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition, to classify incident cases of colon cancer (C180–189). Colon cancers were further subdivided into cancers of the proximal colon (C180–184) and distal colon (C185–187). Participants diagnosed simultaneously with a colon and rectal cancer were included in both colon and rectal cancer analyses.","The baseline questionnaire asked participants to provide information about the number of times per week during the last 12 months they engaged in periods of physical activity or sports that lasted at least 20 min and caused increases in breathing or heart rate, or caused them to work up a sweat (i.e., current exercise/sports). There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week. Subjects were also asked to indicate which of the following categories best described their routine through- out the day at home or work (i.e., daily routine activity): sitting, sitting and walking, standing or walking but not lifting or carrying things, carrying light loads or climbing stairs, and carrying heavy loads or doing heavy work.
The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category. A total physi- cal activity score was created by summing the MET-hours per week of low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity reported during each age period. A lifetime phys- ical activity score was created by averaging the total physical activity scores calculated for each age period.
The second questionnaire also requested information on sedentary behavior by asking about the average number of hours per day currently spent watching television or videos, and the average number of hours per day spent sitting. The response options for those items were as follows: none; less than1h;1–2h;3–4h;5–6h;7–8h;and9ormorehours.

NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study,Howard et al.,2008,81,US,Prospective cohort,"Members of AARP between the ages of 50–71 years old at baseline and residing in one of eight study areas (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, and metropolitan Atlanta and Detroit)","The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study was established in 1995–1996 when 567,169 men and women responded to a mailed baseline questionnaire that requested information on diet, family history of cancer, physical activity, anthropometry, and other lifestyle factors [39]. Respon- dents were members of AARP between the ages of 50–71 years old at baseline and residing in one of eight study areas (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, and metropolitan Atlanta and Detroit). In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to respondents who did not have self-reported prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer at baseline to collect more detailed information on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Among baseline questionnaire respondents, we excluded 179 duplicate questionnaires, 15,760 individuals whose questionnaires were completed by proxies for the intended respondents, 582 persons who died or moved out of the study area before study entry, and 6 people who withdrew from the study. We also excluded 51,193 persons with a previous cancer diagnosis, 997 persons reporting end-stage renal disease, 5,711 subjects with missing information on physical activity, and 4,021 persons who were statistical outliers on reported energy intake. The same exclusion criteria were applied to persons responding to the second questionnaire.",196651,0,0.00,2,"4 rows: gender * domain (f, TPA)",,,,,,,,TPA,50-71,,,,,,,811044.0,colon cancer,incidence,"Histologically confirmed incident colon and rectal cancer cases through 31 December , 2003, were ascertained through probabilistic linkage to the eight state cancer registries serving our cohort and three additional states (AZ, NV, and TX), all of which met the certification requirements defined by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, which are estimated to have 90% case ascertainment within 24 months [42]. For matching purposes, we have virtually complete data on first and last name, address history, gender, and date of birth. All suspected matches underwent a process that rejects those with insufficient degree of similarity to confirm a true match (approximately 4%); uncertain matches underwent final manual review. We conducted a validation study of cancer endpoint ascertainment by linking a subset of our cohort (n = 12,000) to the cancer registries and comparing the data to self-reports and subsequent medical record confirmation of incident cancer in this sub-cohort. We found that approximately 90% of all incident cancers were accurately identified using the registries included in this cohort as the gold standard [42]. We used the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition, to classify incident cases of colon cancer (C180–189). Colon cancers were further subdivided into cancers of the proximal colon (C180–184) and distal colon (C185–187). Participants diagnosed simultaneously with a colon and rectal cancer were included in both colon and rectal cancer analyses.","The baseline questionnaire asked participants to provide information about the number of times per week during the last 12 months they engaged in periods of physical activity or sports that lasted at least 20 min and caused increases in breathing or heart rate, or caused them to work up a sweat (i.e., current exercise/sports). There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week. Subjects were also asked to indicate which of the following categories best described their routine through- out the day at home or work (i.e., daily routine activity): sitting, sitting and walking, standing or walking but not lifting or carrying things, carrying light loads or climbing stairs, and carrying heavy loads or doing heavy work.
The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category. A total physi- cal activity score was created by summing the MET-hours per week of low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity reported during each age period. A lifetime phys- ical activity score was created by averaging the total physical activity scores calculated for each age period.
The second questionnaire also requested information on sedentary behavior by asking about the average number of hours per day currently spent watching television or videos, and the average number of hours per day spent sitting. The response options for those items were as follows: none; less than1h;1–2h;3–4h;5–6h;7–8h;and9ormorehours.

","The baseline questionnaire (1995–1996) queried about demo- graphic characteristics, diet, reproductive and medical history and lifestyle. The physical activity questions on the subse- quent RFQ (1996–1997) predominantly assessed recreational and leisure time activities performed in the last 10 years. Examples of activities include tennis, golf, biking, swimming, heavy gardening, fast walking or dancing, aerobics and jog- ging. Participants reported categorical duration of activities (never, rarely, <1 hr/week, 1–3 hr/week, 4–7 hr/week and >7 hr/week).

Briefly, the study recruited men and women by mailing questionnaires to 3.5 million AARP members aged 50–71 years old from six US states (CA, FL, LA, NJ, NC, and PA) and 2 metropolitan areas (Atlanta, GA and Detroit, MI) between 1995– 1996. A second risk factor questionnaire requesting information on additional risk factors, including waist and hip circumference, weight and height at various points in adulthood, was completed by 337,074 baseline participants six months after the baseline questionnaire. Of the 566,401 individuals who returned the baseline question- naire, we excluded those who had previous cancer at baseline (n = 51,234), proxy respondents (n = 15,760), and those with extreme values (more than two times inter-quartile ranges from the median) of box-cox log transformed total energy intake (n = 4,417), and ever smokers of cigarettes, pipes, or cigars (n = 336,575).",158415,1,0.45,3,1 row,61.80,5.3,,,,,,LTPA,50 - 71,,,never,"ever smokers of cigarettes, pipes or cigars",9.96,2.04,1578092.7,lung cancer,incidence,"We identified cancer cases through probabilistic linkage with 10 state cancer registry databases that included the 8 original states and 3 additional states (Arizona, Nevada, and Texas) that some participants moved to during follow-up.

Using histologic codes from the International Classification of Disease for Oncology (ICD-O, third edition) [15] all primary incident cancers of the bronchus and lung (ICD 34.0– 34.9) were considered for the present analysis. By histologic code, lung carcinomas included small cell (8002, 8041, 8042, 8043, 8044, 8045), adenocarcinoma (bronchoalveolar: 8250, 8251, 8252, 8253, 8254, and other: 8140, 8255, 8260, 8310, 8323, 8480, 8481, 8490, 8550, and 8574), squamous cell (8050, 8070, 8071, 8072, 8073, 8074, and 8075), undifferentiated/large cell (8012, 8020, 8021, 8022, 8031, and 8032), and other not otherwise specified (NOS) carcinoma (8010, 8011, 8033, 8046, and 8560).","Information on physical activity at baseline was obtained from two questions: (1) physical activity at work and (2) vigorous activity, defined as the frequency each week spent at activities that lasted 20 minutes or more and caused either increases in breathing or heart rate or working up a sweat. We classified activities at work into 4 categories: (1) lift and carry loads; (2) walking a lot; (3) mostly sitting with a fair amount of walking; and (4) all day sitting. Information on sedentary behaviors was based on two questions from the risk factor questionnaire: (1) time spent watching TV or videos during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months; and (2) number of hours spent sitting during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months. We classified TV watching or videos and hours spent sitting to the following categories: ,3, 3–4, and $5 hours per day.

Prevalence and incidence of cancer cases were identified through linkage to the Cancer Registry of Norway. Women with an incident, primary, histopathologically confirmed carcinoma of the endometrium were defined as cases. Since 1952, clinicians and pathologists in Norway have been required to report all new cancer cases. An accurate and complete database is achieved through matching with the Register of Deaths at Statistics Norway (SSB). Information about reproductive history, emigration and death was gathered by linkage to SSB. Women were considered to be at risk from the date of the blood sample in the 1977–1981 survey (baseline) through 31 December 1996, or earlier on the occurrence of emigration, death or diagnosis of any cancer. ","The women marked their usual level of recreational and occupational activity on a scale with the following 4 grades: Recreational activity: Grade 1, Reading, watching television or other sedentary activity; Grade 2, Walking, bicycling or other activity for at least 4 hr per week; Grade 3, Recreational athletics, heavy gardening or similar activities at least 4 hr per week; and Grade 4, Regular (several times a week) training or participation in athletic competitions.

Furthermore, for both recreational and occupational activity, a new variable was created containing information from both surveys. Women who reported sedentary activity (grade 1) in both surveys were charac- terized as “consistently sedentary.” Those who reported minimum grade 2 level of activity in the first survey and minimum grade 3 in the next were characterized as “consistently active.” The re- maining women who were neither consistently sedentary nor con- sistently active were characterized as “moderately active.”",,,,Grade 1,Grade 2,Grade 3 + 4,,,,,,,,0.00,18.00,32.00,,,,,,,,0.00,14.00,28.00,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,130,28,85,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rr,"Adjusted for age, geographical region, height, body mass index, recreational or occupational activity and smoking at baseline and parity.

they spent per week doing each of the
following physical activities: walking,
jogging, running, bicycling, calisthenics/
aerobics/aerobic dance/rowing
machine, lap swimming, squash/
racquetball, and tennis. They were also
asked about their usual walking pace,
specified as easy (,2.0 mph), moderate
(2.0-2.9 mph), brisk (3.0-3.9 mph),
or very brisk ($4 mph). From this
information, energy expenditure in
metabolic equivalent tasks (METs),
measured in hours per week, was calculated.
17 Because only 2% of the subjects
reported very brisk pace, we combined
the brisk and very brisk categories
in the analyses of walking pace and
stroke risk.Wedefined any physical activity
requiring 6 METs or more ($6-
fold increase from resting metabolic
rate) as vigorous. These activities included
jogging, running, bicycling,
calisthenics/aerobic/aerobic dance/
rowing machine, lap swimming,
squash/racquetball, and tennis. In contrast,
walking requires an energy
expenditure of only 2.0 to 4.5 METs,
depending on pace; we therefore considered
it to be a moderate-intensity
activity.

were asked to report the average number
of hours they spent each week during
the past year on moderate and vigorous
recreational activities, such as
heavy gardening, vigorous sports, jogging,
brisk/very brisk walking, bicycling,
and heavy housework. On the
1982 questionnaire, women were asked
a slightly different question: “For how
many hours per week, on average, do
you engage in activity strenuous enough
to build up a sweat?” To use this information,
we created a variable representing
average hours per week spent
doing moderate or vigorous recreational
activities (all activities described
heretofore except for hours
spent walking at an easy or normal
pace) across 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988,

CHD deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] occurring after
the return of the 1980 questionnaire but before June 1, 2000). We
sought to obtain medical records for all self-reported MIs. Records
were reviewed by physicians with no knowledge of the self-reported
risk factor status. MI was confirmed according to World Health
Organization criteria: symptoms plus either diagnostic ECG changes
or elevated cardiac enzymes. Deaths were reported by next of kin
and the postal system or ascertained through the National Death
Index. Follow-up for the deaths was more than 98% complete.10
Fatal coronary disease was defined as fatal MI if this was confirmed
by hospital records or autopsy or if coronary disease was listed as the
cause of death on the certificate and this was the underlying and most
plausible cause and if evidence of previous coronary disease was
available. Sudden death within 1 hour of onset of symptoms in
women with no other plausible cause other than coronary disease
(8% of fatal CHD) was also included.",Questionnaire,h/wk,"Physical activity measures were described in detail previously.3
Women were first asked about physical activity on the 1980
questionnaire. They were asked to report the average number of
hours spent each week during the past year on moderate (eg, brisk
walking) and on vigorous recreational activities (eg, vigorous sports
and jogging). A similar question was included in the 1982 questionnaire.
In 1986, 1988, 1992, 1996, and 1998, women were asked to
report the average time spent per week on the following activities:
walking, jogging, running, bicycling, lap swimming, playing tennis
or squash, and participating in calisthenics. Using this information,
we calculated the average amount of time per week spent in
moderate-to-vigorous activities (requiring 3 or more metabolic
equivalents per hour, including brisk walking) at each time point.8
Our validation study indicated relatively good validity and reproducibility
for the questionnaire. The correlation between physical
activity reported on 1-week recalls and that reported on the questionnaire
was 0.79. The correlation between moderate to vigorous
activity reported in diaries and that reported on the questionnaire was
0.62. In a separate population 20 to 59 years of age, recruited from
a university community (n 103), the correlation between the physical

In 1986, 1988, and 1992, the physical activity
questions were more detailed (there were
no physical activity questions on the 1990 survey);
women were asked to report the average
time spent per week during the previous year

hiking outdoors, jogging (slower than 10 minutes
per mile), running (10 minutes per mile

walking pace: easy (less than 2 miles [3.2 km]

The cohort was administered a comprehensive leisure-time physical activity ques- tionnaire in 1986. Thus, 1986 is considered the baseline for the present analyses of physical activity. As described earlier, the physical activity cohort began in 1986 with 82,804 women who completed the physical activity question- naire. Of these, we excluded 216 women reporting colon cancer prior to 1986, 2,489 women with a history of other cancers in 1986, 754 women reporting a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, and 50 women missing year of birth.

A study physician blinded to exposure reviewed the records and extracted information on histologic type, anatomic location and stage. Proximal colon cancers were defined as those from the cecum to and including the splenic flexure, and distal colon cancers were defined as those in the descending and sigmoid colon. Cancers other than confirmed adenocarcinomas were excluded.

",questionnaire,MET-h/wk,"participants reported their average amount of time spent per week during the previous year in each of eight activities: walking or hiking outdoors, jogging (>10 min mile-1), running, bicycling (including stationary machine), racquet sports, lap swimming, calisthenics/aerobics, and other aerobic activity. Although most of these activities were recreational, walking could be nonrecreational. For each activity, women chose one of 10 duration categories that ranged from zero to 11 or more hours per week. Walking pace was also reported as easy, average, brisk, or very brisk. Activity was reassessed in 1991 and 1997.Each activity on the questionnaire was assigned a metabolic equivalent (MET) score based on the classification by Ainsworth et al (1993). The MET score for an activity is defined as the ratio of the metabolic rate associated with that activity divided by the resting metabolic rate. For example, walking at an average pace, jogging, and running were assigned MET scores of 3, 7 and 12, respectively. We calculated MET-hweek??1 for each activity as the reported hours per week engaged in the activity multiplied by the assigned MET score, and the values from the individual activities were summed for a total MET-hweek??1. To obtain the best long- term measure of activity, values for total MET-hweek??1 were cumulatively averaged in analyses; that is, at the beginning of each 2-year follow-up cycle, MET-hweek??1 was the mean of all MET- hweek??1 calculated from the questionnaires up to that time. We selected cutpoints for data analysis a priori to be in three MET increments because three METs is the score for 1 h of walking and we wanted to be able to describe results from our MET-h analyses in terms of the equivalent amount of walking.",results by time spent walking and by time spent running or jogging,,,<3,3-8.9,9-17.9,18-26.9,>=27,,,,,,1.60,5.80,12.90,21.90,41.70,,,,,,1.19,4.33,9.73,16.73,32.77,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,849,95,210,197,131,216,,,,,,106.1,217.5,225.5,140.2,244.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rr,"adjusted for age, height, alcohol intake, age at menarche, age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, history of benign breast disease, mother or sister with breast cancer, and BMI.",1.00,,,1.05,0.82,1.33,0.95,0.74,1.21,1.03,0.79,1.35,1.04,0.82,1.33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"adjusted for age, height, alcohol intake, age at menarche, age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, history of benign breast disease, mother or sister with breast cancer",1,,,1.05,0.82,1.34,0.96,0.75,1.23,1.05,0.8,1.37,1.07,0.84,1.36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"median age at diagnosis (42 years) / mean age according to categories of MET-h per week / exposure is assessed as cumulative average / exposure is mostly recreational, but walking may be non-recreational / results by BMI (<25, 25-29.9, >=30 kg/m^2) and/or oral contraceptive use (never, past, current) (see also other PA domain)",Exclude 1 row - SEPA,,,,,,

Biennially thereafter, participants received follow-up questionnaires to update information on lifestyle factors, including endometrial cancer risk factors, and new disease diagnoses. The response rate in the initial invitation cycle was 71%, and response rates of approximately 90% have been achieved in each follow-up cycle. At the start of follow-up in 1986, when detailed physical activity was first assessed, we excluded nurses who had died or reported previous cancers except non-melanoma skin can- cer (N510,174), reported a hysterectomy or surgical meno- pause (N531,666), or were missing all activity data during follow-up (N 5 8,290).

To confirm cancer diagno- ses, study physicians masked to exposure status reviewed medical records after obtaining permission from participants. Data were collected on histological type, presence of invasion and stage as well as grade. In this analysis, we included cases of invasive endometrial adenocarcinoma (ICD-O histology code 8380/3) because of potential heterogeneity by histologi- cal subtype. Cases were defined by the 1988 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria as stage IA to IVB diagnosed from 1986 to May 2008 and con- firmed by medical records (99% of reported cases confirmed). Women diagnosed with non-epithelial tumors (N5129), types of epithelial tumors other than adenocarcinoma (e.g., squamous cell) (N 5 127) or non-invasive tumors (endome- trial intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical hyperplasia or adeno- carcinoma in situ) (N 5 288) were censored during follow- up.","Detailed information on recreational physical activity during the past year was assessed by questionnaire in 1986. Partici- pants reported their average weekly time spent on any of eight activities: walking or hiking, jogging, running, bicycling, lap swimming, playing tennis, calisthenics/aerobics/aerobic dance/rowing machine and playing squash or racquetball. Participants also reported their usual walking pace and the number of flights of stairs climbed daily. These questions were repeated, with minor changes, every 2–4 years (1988, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2004). Starting in 1992, information was collected on other lower intensity (e.g., yoga, stretching and toning) and vigorous (e.g., lawn mowing) activities. Starting in 1990, participants were asked whether their health limited them in performing typical activities (e.g., walking 1 block, moderate activities and vigorous activities). Physical activity data were carried forward when activity was not included on the biennial questionnaires (e.g., 1988 data used in the 1990–1992 follow-up). However, activity data were not carried forward when women failed to answer phys- ical activity questions (e.g., 1992 data were not carried for- ward if a woman was missing 1994 data).
To incorporate activity frequency, duration and intensity, we calculated total metabolic equivalent (MET) hours of activity per week (MET-hr/week).20,21 During each question- naire cycle, participants with unreasonably high levels of activity (1251 MET-hr/week, or approximately 6 hr per day of average recreational walking) were assigned missing activ- ity values. In analyses of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activities, we defined a priori only brisk or very brisk walk- ing, jogging or running as moderate or vigorous activity. Because of the variable intensity with which activities such as swimming and biking may be performed, excluding these activities may reduce potential misclassification of moderate or vigorous activity.18 In analyses of walking and walking pace, however, we were interested specifically in whether walking was beneficial even if women did not perform any vigorous activities. We thus used a more general definition of vigorous activities, which included any activities that were potentially vigorous (6 METs or greater: jogging, running, bicycling, swimming, tennis, calisthenics/aerobics, racquet sports and other vigorous activity) in analyses of walking.22 We categorized total recreational activity into multiples of 3 as 3 METs represents 1 hr of average walking.20 Moderate or vigorous activity was categorized by hours per week for increased comparability to existing physical activity guidelines.22 For adequate statistical power to examine high levels of activity, we selected category cut points that resulted in an approximately even distribution of cases in higher activity categories.
The reproducibility and validity of these questions have been described previously.23 In a similar population of NHS II participants (N 5 151), the correlation over a 1-year period between activity reported by questionnaire and that assessed by past-week recalls was 0.79, and the correlation between moderate or vigorous activity reported by questionnaire and that assessed by activity diaries was 0.62.",MET-hr/week,We categorized total recreational activity into multiples of 3 as 3 METs represents 1 hr of average walking.,Moderate or vigorous-intensity activity ,,,<3,3-<9,9-<18,18-<27,?27,,,,,,1.30,6.00,13.10,22.50,47.30,,,,,,1.10,4.80,10.40,18.05,40.85,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,683,112,181,176,98,116,,,,,,152164,268222,264877,148550,175695,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,rr,"Adjusted for age at menarche (7–12, >12–13, >13–18, missing years), OC use (never, <1, 1 to <3, 3 to <6, ??6, missing years), parity and age at first birth (nulliparous, 1–2 children <25 years, 1–2 children 25–29 years, 1–2 children ??30 years, 3–4 children <25 years, 3–4 children 25–29 years, 3–4 children ??30 years, ??5 children <25 years, ??5 children ??25 years, missing), age at last birth (nulliparous, <25, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, ??40, missing years), menopausal status (pre-, post-, dubious or missing), age at menopause (continuous), HT (never, past, current <5 years, cur- rent ??5 years, missing), HT type (never, E only, E1P, other, missing), BMI at age 18 (<19, 19 to <21, 21 to <23, ??23, missing kg/m2), pack-years of smoking (0, 0 to <20, 20 to <40, ??40, missing), family history of endometrial cancer (yes, no), family history of colorectal cancer (yes, no), alco- hol intake (none, <5, 5 to <15, ??15, missing g/day) and caffeine intake (quartiles, missing) and recent BMI (continuous).",1.00,,,0.83,0.65,1.06,0.77,0.60,0.98,0.76,0.57,1.00,0.77,0.59,1.01,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adjusted for age at menarche (7–12, >12–13, >13–18, missing years), OC use (never, <1, 1 to <3, 3 to <6, ??6, missing years), parity and age at first birth (nulliparous, 1–2 children <25 years, 1–2 children 25–29 years, 1–2 children ??30 years, 3–4 children <25 years, 3–4 children 25–29 years, 3–4 children ??30 years, ??5 children <25 years, ??5 children ??25 years, missing), age at last birth (nulliparous, <25, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, ??40, missing years), menopausal status (pre-, post-, dubious or missing), age at menopause (continuous), HT (never, past, current <5 years, cur- rent ??5 years, missing), HT type (never, E only, E1P, other, missing), BMI at age 18 (<19, 19 to <21, 21 to <23, ??23, missing kg/m2), pack-years of smoking (0, 0 to <20, 20 to <40, ??40, missing), family history of endometrial cancer (yes, no), family history of colorectal cancer (yes, no), alco- hol intake (none, <5, 5 to <15, ??15, missing g/day) and caffeine intake (quartiles, missing).",1,,,0.84,0.66,1.07,0.79,0.62,1.01,0.78,0.59,1.03,0.81,0.62,1.05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PA assessment is culumative average,Excluded 1 row - MVPA,,,,,,

the medical records of women who reported a nonfatal myocardial
infarction on a follow-up questionnaire. Study physicians who
had no knowledge of the women’s self-reported risk factors reviewed
the records. Nonfatal myocardial infarction was confirmed
if data in the medical records met World Health Organization criteria
for this condition — namely, symptoms and either diagnostic
electrocardiographic changes or elevated cardiac-enzyme levels.
10
Myocardial infarctions that required hospital admission and
for which confirmatory information was obtained by interview or
letter but for which no medical records were available were designated
as probable infarctions (and constituted 17 percent of all
reported nonfatal infarctions). We included all confirmed and
probable cases of infarction in the analyses because the results
were the same whether probable cases were included or excluded. Follow-up information for nonfatal infarction was obtained for
more than 95 percent of the potential person-time of follow-up.

listed as the underlying cause on the death certificate, but for
which no records were available, as due to presumed fatal coronary
disease. These cases constituted 14.7 percent of all fatal coronary

10 minutes per mile [6 minutes per kilometer]), running (at 10
minutes per mile or faster), bicycling (including the use of a stationary
bicycle), swimming laps, playing tennis or squash, or participating
in calisthenics, aerobics, or aerobic dance; in addition,
the women were asked to report the average number of flights of
stairs they climbed each week. Women also reported their usual
walking pace: easy or casual (<2.0 miles per hour [mph] [3.2 km
per hour]), average (2.0 to 2.9 mph [3.2 to 4.6 km per hour]),
brisk (3.0 to 3.9 mph [4.8 to 6.2 km per hour]), or very brisk
(»4.0 mph [6.4 km per hour]). Using a standardized classification
of the energy costs of physical activities,
8
we calculated a
weekly metabolic-equivalent (MET) score for total physical activity,
vigorous activity (»6 MET per hour), nonvigorous activity
(<6 MET per hour), and walking (2.5 to 4.5 MET per hour, depending
on the pace). One MET is the caloric need per kilogram
of body weight per hour of activity, divided by the caloric need
per kilogram per hour at rest. Physical-activity scores were expressed
as MET-hours per week. Validation of the questionnaire
for assessing physical activity has been described previously in a
similar cohort

; the overall correlation between physical activities
reported on the questionnaire and those recorded in four oneweek
diaries was 0.62, and the correlation was 0.79 for activities
reported on the questionnaire and those recalled after one week.

about physical activity that was administered in 1980 and

the average number of hours they spent each week during the
previous year engaged in moderate or vigorous recreational activities,
including vigorous sports, jogging, bicycling, brisk walking,
heavy gardening, or heavy housework. On the 1982 questionnaire,
women were asked the question: “For how many hours per
week, on average, do you engage in activity strenuous enough to
build up a sweat?” To analyze this information, we calculated the

or vigorous recreational activities (all the activities listed above except

For all questions, partici- pants provided open-ended duration responses (hours and minutes). We evaluated the reliability and validity of the SCCS physical activity questionnaire in 118 randomly se- lected SCCS participants and found the validity of the instru- ment to be comparable for blacks and whites (21). Accumulating 1 MET-hour/day of energy ex- penditure from physical activity is achieved by participating in 0.5 hours of a light activity (2 METs per hour), 0.25 hours of moderate intensity activity (4 METs per hour), or 0.125 hours of a vigorous activity (8 METs per hour).",MET-hour/day,,"Overall Sedentary Behavior, slow and fast walking",,,<9.73,9.74-18.6,18.61-32.31,?32.32,,,,,,,4.87,14.17,25.46,39.17,,,,,,,3.78,11.02,19.80,30.47,,,,,,,1,3.78,11.02,19.80,30.47,,,,,,2.70,7.87,14.14,21.76,,,,,,322,115,84,62,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4724.5,4763.1,4676.2,4258.8,,,,,,,hr,"Adjusted for sex, source of enrollment (community health center or general population), educational level (<9 years, 9–11 years, high school, some college, or beyond college), household income (<$15,000, $15,000–$24,999, $25,000–$49,999, or ?$50,000), cigarette smoking (never; former, <1 pack/day; former, ?1 pack/day; current, <1 pack/day; or current, ?1 pack/day), body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2; <18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, 30.0–34.9, or ?35.0), sleep duration (<7, 7–8, or ?9 hours/day), diabetes (yes or no), and employment status (yes or no) and adjusted for overall sedentary behavior (quartiles).",1.00,,,0.95,0.70,1.27,0.82,0.59,1.15,0.95,0.67,1.34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Total participants 63308 and approximately 70% of cohort members were black.

height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, and blood
pressure were obtained by trained staff members. All women provided
written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved
by the institutional review board of each center.
Recreational physical activity was assessed by a detailed questionnaire
on the frequency and duration of walking and of several other
types of activity (strenuous, moderate, and mild). Walking was assessed
by a series of questions about the frequency of walks outside
the home for more than 10 minutes without stopping, the average
duration of each walk, and the usual walking pace. Vigorous
exercise was defined as that in which “you work up a sweat and your
heart beats fast,” and examples included aerobics, aerobic dancing,
jogging, tennis, and swimming laps. Moderate exercise was defined
as that which was “not exhausting,” and examples included biking
outdoors, using an exercise machine (such as a stationary bicycle or
a treadmill), calisthenics, easy swimming, and popular or folk dancing.
Examples of mild exercise were slow dancing, bowling, and
golf. Using a standardized classification of the energy expenditure
associated with physical activities,

asked for permission to review their medical records. A diagnosis of
stroke was confirmed only after medical record review by an End
Points Committee of physicians that included a neurologist. A
nonfatal stroke was defined as a focal neurological deficit of sudden
onset and vascular mechanism that lasted  24 hours. Cases of fatal
stroke were documented by evidence of a cerebrovascular mechanism
obtained from available sources, including death certificates
and hospital records. Stroke was classified according to the National
Survey of Stroke criteria22 as ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or
unknown subtype. The interobserver agreement of the classification
of stroke and its major subtypes was excellent.23","On the baseline survey, women were asked to estimate the average
time (0, 1 to 19 minutes/week, 20 to 59 minutes/week, 1 hour/week,
1.5 hour/week, 2 to 3 hour/week, 4 to 6 hour/week, or  7
hour/week) spent on 8 groups of recreational activities during the
past year: walking or hiking; jogging (slower than 10-minute miles);
running (10-minute miles or faster); bicycling, including use of
stationary machines; aerobic exercise, aerobic dance, use of exercise
machines; tennis, squash, or racquetball; lap swimming, and lowerintensity
exercise, including yoga, stretching, or toning. They also
reported their usual walking pace (do not walk regularly,  3.2
km/hour [2 mph; casual pace], 3.2 to 4.7 km/hour [2 to 2.9 mph;
normal, average pace], 4.8 to 6.3 km/hour [3.0 to 3.9 mph; brisk
pace], or  6.4 km/hour [4.0 mph; very brisk/striding pace]) and the
number of flights of stairs climbed daily (0, 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 9, 10
to 14, or  15). Physical activity was updated at 36, 72, and 96
months during the trial; at trial conclusion (average follow-up, 125
months); and cycle 2 of observational follow-up (24 months after
trial conclusion). We refer to these times as the 36-, 72-, 96-, 125-,
and 149-month follow-up.
We assigned a multiple of resting metabolic rate (metabolic
equivalent score) to each group of activities and stair climbing based
on their energy costs17 and estimated the energy expended on each of
these activities.18 This assessment of physical activity has been
shown to be reliable and valid.19 We summed kilocalories per week
from the 8 groups of recreational activities and stair climbing to
estimate weekly energy expenditure and categorized women into
approximate quartiles of energy expenditure:  200, 200 to 599, 600
to 1499, or  1500 kcal/week, for analyses of physical activity. We
also conducted additional analyses with energy expenditure estimated
in metabolic equivalent-hours/week, a unit independent of
body weight. The results were very similar and so we present results

equivalent task (MET) score was assigned to each activity based on its energy cost. One
MET corresponds to an energy expenditure of approximately 1 kcal/kg of body weight per
hour; thus, energy expenditure in kilocalories per week was estimated by multiplying the
MET score by body weight and hours per week. This assessment of physical activity has
been shown to be valid and reliable(33); for example, the correlation between four 1-week
activity diaries kept over one year and questionnaire estimates of physical activity was 0.62.

Women who continued to be willing and eligible to participate in the trial after a 3-month run-in phase were randomized into the actual trial. A total of 39,876 women free of heart disease, stroke and cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer) were randomized to active drug or placebo22. Follow-up surveys asking about treatment compliance, risk factors and endpoints of interest were mailed every six months during the first year and annually thereafter. Upon completion of the randomized trial component of the WHS in March 2004, women were invited to continue follow-up in an observational study, and 33,796 did (88.0% of those alive). For the present study, follow-up through February 2007 was included. For the present study, we excluded women who reported having had a hysterectomy at baseline (n = 6,500), who did not report their weight status (n = 717) or physical activity (n = 16) at baseline, or who were subsequently found to have cancer at baseline (n = 1).",19917,1,0.00,2,1 row,,,,,,,,LTPA,,,,,,8.80,,,endometrial cancer,incidence,"Every 6 months during the first year and then annually, women completed brief mailed surveys that inquired about endpoints of interest to the trial.

Deaths were reported by family members or postal authorities and by searching the National Death Index. We sought medical records, pathology reports and other relevant information, including death certificates and autopsy reports, for women reporting endometrial cancer, and for decedents. Reported diagnoses of endometrial cancer were considered confirmed only after examination of all available information by an endpoints committee of physicians. Only confirmed cases were included in analyses.","On the baseline survey, we asked women to estimate the average time (0, 1–19 min/wk, 20– 59 min/wk, 1 h/wk, 1.5 h/wk, 2–3 h/wk, 4–6 h/wk, or ?7 h/wk) spent on eight groups of recreational activities during the past year: walking or hiking; jogging (slower than 10-minute miles); running (10-minute miles or faster); bicycling, including use of stationary machines; aerobic exercise, aerobic dance, use of exercise machines; tennis, squash, or racquetball; lap swimming; and lower-intensity exercise, including yoga, stretching, or toning. We also inquired about the usual pace of walking (do not walk regularly; <3.2 km/h [2.0 mph; easy, casual pace], 3.2–4.7 km/h [2.0–2.9 mph; normal, average pace], 4.8–6.3 km/h [3.0–3.9 mph; brisk pace], or ?6.4 km/h [4.0 mph; very brisk/striding pace]) and the number of flights of stairs climbed daily (0, 1–2, 3–4, 5–9, 10–14, or 15)24 on average. Based on the energy cost of these activities, we assigned a multiple of resting metabolic rate (MET score) to each group of activities and stair climbing. We estimated energy expenditure by multiplying the assigned MET score by hours per week of participation using the midpoint of time categories. We summed MET-hours per week from the eight groups of recreational activities and stair climbing to estimate weekly energy expenditure. In analyses of the joint effects of physical activity and BMI, we classified women as “inactive” (<15 MET-hours/week) or “active” (?15 MET-hours/week), based upon a recent expert review on the level of physical activity that is likely to be needed for cancer prevention25. We were also interested in whether walking, a moderate-intensity activity and the most common activity carried out by women26, was associated with risk.

Those eligible and willing to be in the trial were then enrolled into a run-in phase, where for 3 months they received a supply of study pills (all placebos) by mail. At the end of the run-in phase, women completed the runin questionnaire that ascertained compliance with the pill-taking regimen, health habits, and recent medical history. Women who demonstrated good compliance and were still eligible and willing to participate were then randomized.
A total of 39,876 women, aged 345 years and free of self-reported coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer), were randomly assigned to the agents tested.

Every six months during the ®rst year, and then annually, women completed brief mailed questionnaires that inquired about compliance to their assigned treat- ment, serious side-e??ects of study agents, risk factors of interest, and the occurrence of endpoints of interest, including cancer. Women reported a diagnosis of breast cancer on these semi-annual or annual questionnaires, or wrote or telephoned the study. Deaths were usually reported by family members or postal authorities. Follow-up in the Women's Health Study is high; at the 36-month follow-up, morbidity and mortality follow-up was >99% complete.
We sought medical records and all other relevant information for women reporting breast cancer, as well as those deceased. An Endpoints Committee of physi- cians then reviewed these data to con®rm the occurrence of breast cancer. Additional details on breast cancer (size, nodal status, metastases, hormone receptor status, DNA ploidy, S-phase fraction) were also abstracted. Self-reported breast cancers that were not con®rmed by medical records were not used in these analyses. This report includes available data as of 2 February 1998. By then, women had been followed for an average of 48 months, and 411 con®rmed cases of breast cancer (322 invasive and 79 in-situ) had been ascertained. An additional 10 cases that were not con®rmed on medical record review were excluded from these analyses.","We obtained information on physical activity from the run-in questionnaire. Women were asked to estimate the average time per week, during the past year, spent on each of eight groups of recreational activities: walking or hiking; jogging (slower than 10-minute miles); running (10-minute miles or faster); bicycling (including use of stationary machines); aerobic exercise, aerobic dance, or use of exercise machines; lower- intensity exercise, yoga, stretching, or toning; tennis, squash, or racquetball; and lap swimming. In addition, we asked for the usual pace of walking and the number of  ?ights of stairs climbed daily. Based on the rate of energy expenditure required by these activities, we assigned a multiple of resting metabolic rate (MET score) to each group of activities and stair climbing [26]. Since resting metabolic rate is approximately 4.2 kJ/kg body weight per hour, we calculated the energy expended per week on each group of activities and stair climbing by multiplying the assigned MET score by 4.2, body weight and hours per week of participa- tion [27]. (We assumed a rate of 70 steps per minute to estimate the time spent in climbing stairs [28].) We then summed kilojoules per week from the eight groups of activities, plus stair climbing, to estimate the weekly energy expenditure on recreational activities for each woman.
