50,?,,,EPIC Study,Steindorf et al.,2013,Europe,Prospective cohort,Adult women from European study countries.,"There were 366,521 women enrolled between 1992 and 2000 in 23 regional or national centers in 10 Euro- pean countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and United King- dom). These participants were recruited from the general population from defined areas in each country with some exceptions: women who were members of a health insurance scheme for state school employees in France; women attend- ing breast cancer screening in Utrecht, the Netherlands; blood donors in some Italian and Spanish centers, and a high number of vegans and vegetarians in the Oxford ‘‘Health conscious’’ cohort. Women were mostly aged between 35 and 70 years at enrollment and provided written informed con- sent at the time they completed the standardized baseline questionnaires on diet, reproductive characteristics, socio-de- mographic variables, lifestyle and medical history. The present study is based on data from 345,158 participants after excluding a priori women with prevalent cancer at any site apart from nonmelanoma skin cancers at baseline exami- nation. Further, we excluded the study centers Malmo (Swe- den), Granada and Murcia (Spain) (n 1?4 26,091) as for these subcohorts receptor information could not be provided, and we also excluded women with missing nondietary question- naire data or missing or nonstandardized physical activity questionnaire data, comprising the full Norwegian subcohort (n 1?4 35,890) and the Umea? center (Sweden, n 1?4 12,513).",257805,1,0,2,51.3,,,,TPA,10.8,,2782367,breast cancer,incidence,"In most countries (Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom), incident breast cancer cases were identified through a linkage with population-based cancer registries. For these centers, follow-up was completed as fol- lows: December 2004 (Asturias), December 2006 (Florence, Varese, Ragusa, Naples and San Sebastian), December 2007 (Navarra, Oxford, Bilthoven, Aarhus and Copenhagen), Janu- ary 2008 (Utrecht), June 2008 (Cambridge) and December 2008 (Turin). Active follow-up of study participants and next-of-kin, as well as of social security records, and cancer and pathology registries was used in France, Germany and Greece. For centers using active follow-up, end of follow-up was the last known contact, date of diagnosis, or date of death. Mortality data were coded according to the 10th Revi- sion of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (ICD-10) and cancer incidence data were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-2). ",,"A description of the physical activity ascertainment, validity and reproducibility used in the EPIC study has been pub- lished in detail elsewhere.28–30 Physical activity data were obtained either by face-to-face interviews (Germany, Greece, Spain) or were self-administered (Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and UK) using a standardized questionnaire in all centers included in this analysis. Data on current occupa- tional activity included employment status and the level of physical activity done at work (nonworker, sedentary, stand- ing, manual, heavy manual and unknown). Housewives were categorized as nonworkers. In the Danish centers, the ques- tionnaire focused on type of work activity done within the last year, and participants who did not answer this question were categorized as nonworking.
The number of hours per week of nonoccupational physi- cal activities during the past year were collected in all centers and was comprised household activities, including house- work, home repair (do-it-yourself activities), gardening and stair climbing, and recreational activities including walking, cycling and sports combined as done in winter and summer separately. Since the intensity of recreational and household activities was not directly recorded, a metabolic equivalent (MET) value was assigned to each reported activity according to the Compendium of Physical Activities.31 A MET is defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to a standard metabolic rate of 1.0 kcal (4.184 kJ)/kg/hr, one MET is considered a resting metabolic rate obtained during quiet sitting. The MET values assigned to the nonoccupational data were: 3.0 for walking, 6.0 for cycling, 4.0 for gardening, 6.0 for sports, 4.5 for home repair (do-it-yourself work), 3.0 for housework and 8.0 for stair climbing. These mean MET values were obtained by estimating the average of all comparable activ- ities in the Compendium. The mean number of hours per week of summer and winter household and recreational activities were estimated and then multiplied by the appropri- ate MET values to obtain MET-hours/week of activity.
Housework (including child and older adult care), home repair, gardening, and stair climbing were combined to obtain an overall estimate of household activity. Walking (including walking to work, shopping and leisure time), cycling (including cycling to work, shopping and leisure time) and sports activities were combined to derive overall recreational physical activity. Household and recreational activities in MET-hours/week were combined and cohort par- ticipants classified according to EPIC-wide quartiles of total nonoccupational physical activity.

Women who reported their age at menopause at the time of enrollment or during follow-up (available from second questionnaire for some of the women) were categorized as postmenopausal. All other women, including those with missing information on age at menopause, were catego- rized as postmenopausal once they reached 53 years of age during follow-up, i.e., 53 years of age was used as a proxy for age at menopause. This cut-off was based on the definition used in the Million Women Study, and later in the NOWAC study [66-68]. Based on these criteria, we excluded all premenopausal women (n = 12,235).

Of the remainder, 55,838 completed the baseline questionnaires (response rate 83%). All eligible subjects were sent 5-year (1995–1998; response rate 80%) and 10-year follow-up questionnaires (2000–2003; response rate 78%). We excluded women with a self-reported history of cancer before the start of follow-up (n=1,509). To investigate the impact of leisure-time physical activity (LPA) on breast cancer risk, we excluded women with missing information on LPA (n=751). Age–area-adjusted analysis was conducted in 53,578 women.
Further, we then excluded women who had missing or unreliable information on height, BMI, BMI at age 20years (b14 or ?40), alcohol intake, smoking, or use of exogenous female hormones (EFH) (n = 13,804), as well as those with a family history of breast cancer (n=210) and women who reported unreasonable estimates of total energy intake (±3SD) (n=395). Finally, 39,169 women were included in multivariable-adjusted analysis. ",53578,1,0,2,,,,,LTPA,14.5,,780093,breast cancer,incidence,"Breast cancer cases were identified by active patient notification from major local hospitals and data linkage with population-based cancer registries, with permission from the local governments responsible for the registries. Cases were defined as codes C500—509 (World Health Organization, 2000). Diagnosis was microscopically verified for 97% of all case patients. ER/PR status was evaluated by either immunohistochemical assay or enzyme-linked immunoassay. The cut-off point for positive receptor status was defined by clinical estimation at the treating hospital or by the assay method of the clinical laboratory. In most but not all cases, hormone receptor-positivity was defined as the presence of ?10fmol/mg protein in enzyme-linked immunoassay or by the finding of any positive cells in a specimen in immunohistochemical assay.",,questionnaire,frequency,"The main exposure of interest was participation frequency in LPA. We inquired about the frequency of participation in non-occupational LPA, such as sports and exercise, at the baseline and 5-year follow-up surveys. In both questionnaires, we asked ‘How many times did you participate in sports and PA other than during working hours,’ with five predefined categories of almost never exercise: 1–3 days per month, 1–2 days per week, 3–4 days per week, and almost daily. In cohort II, we evaluated the impact of DTPA on breast cancer risk. DTPA was measured as metabolic equivalents (METs-hours/day). Calculation in METs has been explained elsewhere (Inoue et al., 2008). The same methods were used in the baseline and 5-year follow-up surveys because they contained common questions on sleeping time, heavy physical work or strenuous exercise, standing or walking time, and sitting time.

The National Death Index is an accurate method of ascertaining deaths in observational studies, with high sensitivity (96%) and specificity (100%).19 The underlying cause of death was determined from the index or by nosologist review of official death certificates obtained from the department of vital records in the decedent’s state of residence. Death due to cancer was defined by ICD-9 codes 140 to 208 and ICD-10 codes C00 to C97.",,"A formerly validated question- naire was used to assess self-reported leisure-time physical activity over the past 3 months.15 We cre- ated physical activity categories on the basis of re- sponses to 10 specific activities: walking, jogging, running, treadmill exercise, cycling, stationary cy- cling, swimming, racquet sports, aerobic dance, and other sports-related activities (eg, basketball and soccer). Additional questions about the frequency (number of workouts per week) and duration (min- utes of workout per session) of physical activity were also asked. The intensity of activities was esti- mated via speed-specific or activity-specific meta- bolic equivalent (MET) values from the Compen- dium of Physical Activities.16 The MET value for a given speed or activity was multiplied by the fre- quency and the duration and summed over all ac- tivities, resulting in total MET-minutes per week of physical activity.",MET-min/wk,"All participants were classified into 3 categories on the basis of the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans17: inactive (0 MET-min/wk), insuffi- cient (1-499 MET-min/wk), and recommended (??500 MET-min/wk).

The CCR is a population- based cancer registry established by state legislation mandating cancer reporting; the CCR is estimated to be over 99% complete (Kwong et al, 2001). The high standards maintained by the CCR ensure that follow-up for cancer outcomes are virtually complete as long as cohort members reside in California. Linkage between the CTS cohort and the CCR database is based on full name, date of birth, address and social security number and includes manual review of possible matches. California and national mortality files were used to ascertain date and cause of death. Follow-up time was calculated as the number of days between the date of baseline questionnaire completion and the first occurrence of a first diagnosis of endometrial cancer. The end date of follow-up is defined as the date of endometrial cancer diagnosis, date of a move for 44 months out of California, date of death – or the end date of follow-up – whichever came first.",,"Participants provided detailed information on the baseline questionnaire regarding their recreational physical activity during various time periods in their lives.

For each time period, participants were asked to indicate the average amount of time spent participating in strenuous intensity physical activity (e.g., swimming laps, aerobics/calisthenics, running and jogging) and moderate-intensity activity (e.g., brisk walking, recreational tennis, golf, softball and volleyball). Participants reported the average number of hours per week (none, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4–6, 7–10, andX11 h per week) and average number of months per year (1–3, 4–6, 7–9 and 10–12 months per year) for each level of physical activity intensity in which they participated. For each time period and intensity level, the average annual hours per week was multiplied by months per year of participation and divided by total years to estimate average hours per week per year. The midpoint value of the hours per week and months per year categories was assigned, when appropriate, in making these calculations. A conservative value of 12 was assigned to the category X11 h per week. Long-term recreational physical activity was calculated by multiplying the average hours per week per year for each time period by the number of total years spent in that time period. These values were then summed across all time periods and divided by the total number of years.  Recent physical activity was calculated in a manner similar to that outlined for long-term activity, by calculating the average hours per week per year of strenuous and moderate physical activity for the 3 years prior to cohort enrolment (baseline).

Beginning in 1997, follow-up questionnaires were sent to cohort members every 2 years to update exposure informa- tion and to ascertain newly diagnosed cancers. All follow-up ques- tionnaire response rates (after multiple mailings) among living cohort members are at least 88%. End of follow-up for the present analysis was June 30, 2003.
We excluded from this analysis 3,190 women who were lost to follow-up (i.e., alive at the first follow-up questionnaire in 1997 but did not return the 1997 or any subsequent follow-up question- naire), who reported prevalent cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) at baseline (N 5 12,053), who reported not being post- menopausal (N 5 4,291) or who had a hysterectomy or unknown hysterectomy status at baseline (N 5 30,724). We also excluded women with missing information on recreational physical activity at baseline (N 5 640) or BMI at baseline (N 5 756). To eliminate the strong effect of estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (ERT) on endometrial cancer and the possibility that reports of ERT only use were in error (because this regimen is contraindi- cated in women with an intact uterus), we excluded women who reported current ERT use in 1992 (N 5 1,583) and those with cur- rent or past postmenopausal hormone use of unknown type in 1992 (n 5 1,812). Finally, we excluded reported cases of endome- trial cancer that could not be verified through medical or cancer registry records (N 5 33) or cases with missing or potentially unrelated histologies such as endometrial stromal sarcoma (histol- ogy code 8930), adenosarcoma (code 8933), Mullerian mixed tumor (code 8950), endometrial adenofibroma (code 8381) and carcinosarcoma (code 8980) (n 5 32). The etiology of these less common tumors is thought to be different from endometrial carci- nomas. Women who did not return a 1999, 2001 or 2003 question- naire were censored at the return of their last questionnaire. Women who underwent a hysterectomy were censored when first reported on the 1997, 1999 or 2001 questionnaire.",42672,1,0,2,62.8,6,,,LTPA,9.261272028,,395197,endometrial cancer,incidence,"Cases were identified initially by self-report on a follow-up questionnaire and subsequently verified from medical records (n 5 326) or linkage with state cancer registries (n 5 107).

A MET, or metabolic equiva- lent, is the ratio of metabolic rate during a specific activity to rest- ing metabolic rate.27 Because of the older age of this population, the summary MET score for each participant was calculated by multiplying the lowest number of hours within each category times the moderate intensity MET score for each activity accord- ing to the Compendium of Physical Activities27 to provide conser- vatively estimated summary measures. The MET scores for vari- ous activities were27: 3.5 for walking, 7.0 for jogging/running, 7.0 for lap swimming, 6.0 for tennis or racquetball, 4.0 for bicycling/ stationary biking, 4.5 for aerobics/calisthenics and 3.5 for dancing.

For reference, 31.5 MET-hr/week corresponds to approximately 1 hr of moderate-paced walking (3.0 mph) per day.
In addition to recreational leisure activity at baseline, nonre- creational leisure activity was also examined based on information collected from the question ‘‘During the past year, what was the average time per week you spent at the following kinds of activ- ities: gardening/mowing/planting, heavy housework/vacuuming, heavy home repair/painting and shopping?’’ The above algorithm was used to calculate MET-hr/week using the following values for each activity27: 3.0 for gardening/mowing/planting, 2.5 for heavy housework/vacuuming, 3.0 for heavy home repair/painting and 2.5 for shopping. Baseline nonrecreational leisure activity was catego- rized in quartiles of MET-hr/week as none, >0–5.0, >5.0–<10.0, 10.0–<18.5 or !18.5.
For both recreational and nonrecreational physical activity, women who reported being inactive were not used as the referent group because of the possibility that their complete inactivity may be due to underlying conditions related in some way to endome- trial cancer risk.

Beginning in 1997, follow-up questionnaires were sent to cohort members every 2 years to update exposure informa- tion and to ascertain newly diagnosed cancers. All follow-up ques- tionnaire response rates (after multiple mailings) among living cohort members are at least 88%. End of follow-up for the present analysis was June 30, 2003.
We excluded from this analysis 3,190 women who were lost to follow-up (i.e., alive at the first follow-up questionnaire in 1997 but did not return the 1997 or any subsequent follow-up question- naire), who reported prevalent cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer) at baseline (N 5 12,053), who reported not being post- menopausal (N 5 4,291) or who had a hysterectomy or unknown hysterectomy status at baseline (N 5 30,724). We also excluded women with missing information on recreational physical activity at baseline (N 5 640) or BMI at baseline (N 5 756). To eliminate the strong effect of estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (ERT) on endometrial cancer and the possibility that reports of ERT only use were in error (because this regimen is contraindi- cated in women with an intact uterus), we excluded women who reported current ERT use in 1992 (N 5 1,583) and those with cur- rent or past postmenopausal hormone use of unknown type in 1992 (n 5 1,812). Finally, we excluded reported cases of endome- trial cancer that could not be verified through medical or cancer registry records (N 5 33) or cases with missing or potentially unrelated histologies such as endometrial stromal sarcoma (histol- ogy code 8930), adenosarcoma (code 8933), Mullerian mixed tumor (code 8950), endometrial adenofibroma (code 8381) and carcinosarcoma (code 8980) (n 5 32). The etiology of these less common tumors is thought to be different from endometrial carci- nomas.

A MET, or metabolic equiva- lent, is the ratio of metabolic rate during a specific activity to rest- ing metabolic rate.27 Because of the older age of this population, the summary MET score for each participant was calculated by multiplying the lowest number of hours within each category times the moderate intensity MET score for each activity accord- ing to the Compendium of Physical Activities27 to provide conser- vatively estimated summary measures.

A metabolic equivalent task (MET) score was assigned to each activity based on its energy cost (1). To calculate the amount of energy expended, the time spent at each activity in hours per week was multiplied by its MET score then summed over all activities to yield total MET-hours/week. Vigorous activities, defined as requiring MET values ? 6, were jogging (>10 minutes/mile), running (?10 minutes/mile), bicycling, swimming, tennis, squash or racquetball, and rowing. Moderate activities (3 ? METs < 6) were brisk walking, heavy outdoor work, and weight training. To represent long-term levels of exercise more accurately and to reduce measurement error(9), we calculated the cumulative average of physical activity levels from all available questionnaires up to the start of each 2-year follow-up interval(10).
The validity and reproducibility of the physical activity questionnaire have been reported in detail elsewhere(3). Briefly, Pearson correlations between four 1-week diaries and the questionnaire was 0.65 for total activity, 0.58 for vigorous-intensity activity, and 0.28 for non-vigorous activity.

assessed every 2 years between 1986 and

hiking outdoors, jogging ( 6mph),running

tennis, squash or racquetball, calisthenics,

beginning in 1986. Heavy outdoor work

in 1990. Walking pace, categorized as
casual ( 2 mph), normal (2-2.9 mph),
brisk (3-3.9 mph), or striding ( 4mph),

activity in hours per week was multiplied
by its typical energy expenditure,
expressed in metabolic equivalent tasks
(METs),4 then summed over all activities,
to yield a MET-hour score. One
MET,the energyexpendedbysitting quietly,
is equivalent to 3.5 mL of oxygen
uptake per kilogram of body weight per
minute, or to 1 kcal/kg of body weight
per hour. Vigorous activities were
defined as those requiring 6 METs or
more: jogging, running, bicycling, lap
swimming, tennis, squash or racquetball,
and rowing. Nonvigorous activities

A total of 41,836 women (43%) returned the questionnaire and became the study co- hort. Respondents and nonrespondents had similar incidence rates of endometrial cancer (20). Prevalent can- cers were identified, for exclusion, by asking the women if they had ever been told by a physician that they had any form of cancer, excluding skin cancer. Of the 41,836 respondents, we first excluded women who had a prevalent cancer and those who were not postmenopausal (n = 4,377); then, women who had undergone a hysterectomy (n = 12,289); then, women who indicated implausible energy intake levels (<600 or >5,000 calories per day) or who left ?30 missing items in the food frequency questionnaire (n = 1,817); and last, women with endometrial sarcomas or Muellerian mixed tumors (n = 18).

Participants who reported a history of cancer (other than skin cancer) at baseline were excluded. Subcohort members contributed to the person-time at risk until the end of follow-up or until censoring. ",,"Classification of baseline nonoccupational physical activ- ity was based on 2 questions. The first (open-ended) ques- tion was, “How many minutes do you spend on average per day walking/cycling to your work, to go shopping, or to walk your dog?” The reported time spent per day was categorized as ?10, >10–30, >30–60, and >60 minutes/ day. The second question was, “How many hours of your leisure time do you spend on average per week on 1) recre- ational walking/cycling, 2) gardening/doing odd jobs, and 3) sports/gymnastics?” Possible answers were never, <1, 1–2, and >2 hours/week. Men with low occupational energy expenditure or high occupational sitting time may be active outside their jobs and vice versa. Therefore, for men, we combined occupa- tional measures with the baseline nonoccupational physical activity measure. Low occupational energy expenditure and occupational sitting time were defined as <8 kJ/minute and >6–8 hours/day, respectively, as these categories comprised 58.6% of the male subcohort. In accordance with health recommendations (1), low nonoccupational physical activity was considered to be ?30 minutes/day. Moreover, because sports activity is likely to be only a small part of total phys- ical activity, we combined the occupational energy expen- diture measure in men and the baseline nonoccupational physical activity measure in women with the measures of former sports participation and sports participation around puberty.",minutes/day,"Answers on both questions were summed to obtain an overall measure with categories of ?30, >30–60, >60–90, and >90 minutes/day.","Occupational physical activity, Former sports participation

A question- naire consisting leisure-time physical activity questions including type of activity and frequency of the activity in the past month was queried in the Household Adult Ques tionnaire administered once at baseline. There was no additional follow-up information on physical activity and other variables after time of entry into the study until the end of mortality follow-up (Figure 1). At baseline, participants were asked for example, if “In the past month, did you run or jog?” and “In the past month, how often did you jog or run?” Similarly, questions were asked on walking, bicycling, swimming, aerobics and/or aerobic dancing, other dancing, calisthenics, yard work, lifting weights, and engagement in up to four other activities that were not mentioned in the survey. Frequency of engagement in activities over the past 30 days was reported. These responses were standardized to weekly frequency by using the conversion factors of 4.3 weeks/month and 30.4 days/month per NHANES III [15]. A validated intensity rating in metabolic equivalents (MET) was provided by NHANES III for each activity as defined in the Compendium of Physical Activities [16]. For exam- ple, jogging/running was assigned an intensity rating of “8 METS.” For this study, LTPA was classified as “low inten- sity,” “moderate” and “vigorous” using the standard cut-offs established by Pate et al. [17]. Activities requiring <3 METS were classified as “low-intensity,” activities requiring 3– 6 METS were classified as “moderate” and >6 METS were classified as “vigorous” [17]. Participants who did not re- port engagement in any of the activities, were classified as “inactive.” Because individuals engaging in “low intensity” activities represented <0.05% (n = 7) of the population, they were combined into the “moderate” activity group.
Next, participants were categorized as performing “reg- ular low-to-moderate” exercises if they reported performing the activity at least 5 times per week and “regular vigorous” if they reported performing vigorous activities at least 3 times per week. These categories were mutually exclusive (so that if an individual performed vigorous and low-to-moderate activities, he/she was included in the vigorous activity group and not in both groups). Additionally, a frequency-weighted LTPA variable was calculated by multiplying the frequency of each activity by its corresponding intensity value and summed. This variable was divided into quartiles in the regression models. The NHANES III survey did not collect information for duration of each bout of exercise, which limits more precise estimation of physical activity.

In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to the baseline questionnaire respondents to collect additional information on physical activity, menopausal HT use, medical history, and history of cancer. After excluding individuals who died (n=261) or moved out of the cancer registry ascertainment area (n=321) before their baseline questionnaire was received and scanned, proxy respondents to the baseline questionnaire (n=15,760), six individuals who withdrew from the study, and 325,174 men. In our analysis of baseline physical activity data, we excluded 23,911 women who reported a personal cancer history other than non-melanoma skin cancer, 82,132 who reported a prior hysterectomy, and 2,934 women with unknown hysterectomy status. We also excluded women who reported at baseline that their menstrual periods stopped due to surgery (n=1,829) or because of radiation or chemotherapy (n=117), 76 who developed non- epithelial endometrial cancer during follow-up, 8 with no follow-up, 421 (including 4 cases) who were missing baseline information on both daily routine and vigorous activity, and women with missing (n=3,530, including 31 cases) or extreme (defined as > two interquartile ranges from the mean; n=889, including 33 cases) values for baseline BMI (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters).",109621,1,0,2,,,,,LTPA,6.940755877,,760852.6,endometrial cancer,incidence,"Incident endometrial cancers were initially identified through probabilistic linkage to eight state cancer registries using first and last name, address, sex, date of birth, and Social Security Number. The cancer registry ascertainment area was recently expanded to include three additional states (TX, AZ, and NV) to capture cancer occurring among participants who moved to those states during follow-up. Histology was defined using International Classification of Diseases for Oncology codes, 3rd edition.31 A previous validation study in this cohort estimated that registry linkage validly identified approximately 90% of all incident cancers.",,"The baseline questionnaire captured several measures of physical activity. Participants were asked to select a response that best described their current daily routine activity, excluding exercise or sports: sit without walking very much; sit but walk fair amount; stand or walk a lot without carrying or lifting things; lift or carry light loads or climb stairs/hills often; or do heavy work or carry heavy loads. Participants were asked to indicate their frequency of vigorous physical activity during a typical month in the past 12 months: never, rarely, 1–3 times per month, 1–2 times per week, 3–4 times per week, or ? 5 times per week. Vigorous activity was defined as physical activity at work or home including exercise, sports, and carrying heavy loads that lasted ? 20 minutes and caused increases in breathing, heart rate, or sweating. Using the same response categories, participants were also asked to recall their frequency of participation in physical activities or sports during a typical month around the ages of 15–18 years old. We collapsed the never and rarely response categories for analysis.
The second questionnaire asked about several domains of physical activity: occupational, recreational and household, and physical inactivity. History of occupational physical activity was assessed by asking participants if they ever had a job requiring physically demanding work. Those responding affirmatively were asked to report the number of (none, 1–2, 3–5, or ? 6 jobs) and total number of years spent (none or <1 year, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or ? 10 years) in these jobs. The second questionnaire also assessed whether participants ever had a job in which they walked or biked to work for most days of the week and if so, the total number of years they did so (none, <1 year, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or ? 10 years). We combined the none and <1 year response categories for analysis.
Participants were instructed not to include occupational physical activity when reporting how often they participated in “light” and “moderate and vigorous” recreational and household activities. They could choose from the following options: never, rarely, weekly but <1 hour per week, 1–3 hours per week, 4–7 hours per week, and >7 hours per week. Participants were asked to read lists of examples of “light” and “moderate and vigorous” recreational and household activities and to select the option that best described how often they participated during various ages and time periods: 15–18, 19–29, and 35–39 years old, and in the past 10 years. The never and rarely response categories were collapsed for analysis. Since these physical activity questions captured frequency and dose, we calculated hours exercised per week and metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week using the Compendium of Physical Activities as a guide.30 First, midpoint values were used for each category of reported frequency/dose of participation in weekly activity: never/rarely was assigned a value of 0 hours; <1 hour per week was assigned a value of 0.5 hours; 1–3 hours per week was assigned a value of 2 hours; 4–7 hours per week was assigned a value of 5.5 hours; and >7 hours per week was assigned a value of 8 hours. MET values were then assigned to each level of activity: light activities, 3.0 MET; and moderate/vigorous activities, 7.0 MET. These MET values were multiplied by the values of activity hours per week and summed across the activity levels to determine MET-hours per week for each of the various ages and time periods.
Information on physical inactivity was based on two questions. Participants were asked about time spent watching TV or videos during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months. Time spent watching TV or videos was categorized as none, <1 hour, 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and ? 9 hours. In a separate question, participants were also asked to indicate the number of hours spent sitting during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months: <3, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and ? 9 hours. Both measures of inactivity were collapsed as <3, 3–4, 5–6, and ? 7 hours per day.",frequency (of at least 20 mins of vigorous activity),,"Current daily routine activity at work or home; Frequency of participation in physical activities or sports during typical month between ages 15–18 years

We collapsed the never and rarely response categories for analysis.
The second questionnaire asked about several domains of physical activity: occupational, recreational and household, and physical inactivity. History of occupational physical activity was assessed by asking participants if they ever had a job requiring physically demanding work. Those responding affirmatively were asked to report the number of (none, 1–2, 3–5, or ? 6 jobs) and total number of years spent (none or <1 year, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or ? 10 years) in these jobs. The second questionnaire also assessed whether participants ever had a job in which they walked or biked to work for most days of the week and if so, the total number of years they did so (none, <1 year, 1–2, 3–5, 6–9, or ? 10 years). We combined the none and <1 year response categories for analysis.
Participants were instructed not to include occupational physical activity when reporting how often they participated in “light” and “moderate and vigorous” recreational and household activities. They could choose from the following options: never, rarely, weekly but <1 hour per week, 1–3 hours per week, 4–7 hours per week, and >7 hours per week. Participants were asked to read lists of examples of “light” and “moderate and vigorous” recreational and household activities and to select the option that best described how often they participated during various ages and time periods: 15–18, 19–29, and 35–39 years old, and in the past 10 years. The never and rarely response categories were collapsed for analysis. Since these physical activity questions captured frequency and dose, we calculated hours exercised per week and metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week using the Compendium of Physical Activities as a guide.30 First, midpoint values were used for each category of reported frequency/dose of participation in weekly activity: never/rarely was assigned a value of 0 hours; <1 hour per week was assigned a value of 0.5 hours; 1–3 hours per week was assigned a value of 2 hours; 4–7 hours per week was assigned a value of 5.5 hours; and >7 hours per week was assigned a value of 8 hours. MET values were then assigned to each level of activity: light activities, 3.0 MET; and moderate/vigorous activities, 7.0 MET. These MET values were multiplied by the values of activity hours per week and summed across the activity levels to determine MET-hours per week for each of the various ages and time periods.
Information on physical inactivity was based on two questions. Participants were asked about time spent watching TV or videos during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months. Time spent watching TV or videos was categorized as none, <1 hour, 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and ? 9 hours. In a separate question, participants were also asked to indicate the number of hours spent sitting during a typical 24-hour period over the past 12 months: <3, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, and ? 9 hours.

Respon- dents were members of AARP between the ages of 50–71 years old at baseline and residing in one of eight study areas (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, and metropolitan Atlanta and Detroit). In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to respondents who did not have self-reported prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer at baseline to collect more detailed information on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Among baseline questionnaire respondents, we excluded 179 duplicate questionnaires, 15,760 individuals whose questionnaires were completed by proxies for the intended respondents, 582 persons who died or moved out of the study area before study entry, and 6 people who withdrew from the study. We also excluded 51,193 persons with a previous cancer diagnosis, 997 persons reporting end-stage renal disease, 5,711 subjects with missing information on physical activity, and 4,021 persons who were statistical outliers on reported energy intake. The same exclusion criteria were applied to persons responding to the second questionnaire.",292069,0,1,1,,,,,LTPA,6.676822943,,1950093,colon cancer,incidence,"Histologically confirmed incident colon and rectal cancer cases through 31 December , 2003, were ascertained through probabilistic linkage to the eight state cancer registries serving our cohort and three additional states (AZ, NV, and TX), all of which met the certification requirements defined by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, which are estimated to have 90% case ascertainment within 24 months [42]. For matching purposes, we have virtually complete data on first and last name, address history, gender, and date of birth. All suspected matches underwent a process that rejects those with insufficient degree of similarity to confirm a true match (approximately 4%); uncertain matches underwent final manual review. We conducted a validation study of cancer endpoint ascertainment by linking a subset of our cohort (n = 12,000) to the cancer registries and comparing the data to self-reports and subsequent medical record confirmation of incident cancer in this sub-cohort. We found that approximately 90% of all incident cancers were accurately identified using the registries included in this cohort as the gold standard [42]. We used the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition, to classify incident cases of colon cancer (C180–189). Colon cancers were further subdivided into cancers of the proximal colon (C180–184) and distal colon (C185–187). Participants diagnosed simultaneously with a colon and rectal cancer were included in both colon and rectal cancer analyses.",,"The baseline questionnaire asked participants to provide information about the number of times per week during the last 12 months they engaged in periods of physical activity or sports that lasted at least 20 min and caused increases in breathing or heart rate, or caused them to work up a sweat (i.e., current exercise/sports). There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week. Subjects were also asked to indicate which of the following categories best described their routine through- out the day at home or work (i.e., daily routine activity): sitting, sitting and walking, standing or walking but not lifting or carrying things, carrying light loads or climbing stairs, and carrying heavy loads or doing heavy work.
The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category. A total physi- cal activity score was created by summing the MET-hours per week of low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity reported during each age period. A lifetime phys- ical activity score was created by averaging the total physical activity scores calculated for each age period.
The second questionnaire also requested information on sedentary behavior by asking about the average number of hours per day currently spent watching television or videos, and the average number of hours per day spent sitting. The response options for those items were as follows: none; less than1h;1–2h;3–4h;5–6h;7–8h;and9ormorehours.

Respon- dents were members of AARP between the ages of 50–71 years old at baseline and residing in one of eight study areas (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, and metropolitan Atlanta and Detroit). In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to respondents who did not have self-reported prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer at baseline to collect more detailed information on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Among baseline questionnaire respondents, we excluded 179 duplicate questionnaires, 15,760 individuals whose questionnaires were completed by proxies for the intended respondents, 582 persons who died or moved out of the study area before study entry, and 6 people who withdrew from the study. We also excluded 51,193 persons with a previous cancer diagnosis, 997 persons reporting end-stage renal disease, 5,711 subjects with missing information on physical activity, and 4,021 persons who were statistical outliers on reported energy intake.

For matching purposes, we have virtually complete data on first and last name, address history, gender, and date of birth. All suspected matches underwent a process that rejects those with insufficient degree of similarity to confirm a true match (approximately 4%); uncertain matches underwent final manual review. We conducted a validation study of cancer endpoint ascertainment by linking a subset of our cohort (n = 12,000) to the cancer registries and comparing the data to self-reports and subsequent medical record confirmation of incident cancer in this sub-cohort. We found that approximately 90% of all incident cancers were accurately identified using the registries included in this cohort as the gold standard [42]. We used the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition, to classify incident cases of colon cancer (C180–189). Colon cancers were further subdivided into cancers of the proximal colon (C180–184) and distal colon (C185–187). Participants diagnosed simultaneously with a colon and rectal cancer were included in both colon and rectal cancer analyses.",,"The baseline questionnaire asked participants to provide information about the number of times per week during the last 12 months they engaged in periods of physical activity or sports that lasted at least 20 min and caused increases in breathing or heart rate, or caused them to work up a sweat (i.e., current exercise/sports). There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week. Subjects were also asked to indicate which of the following categories best described their routine through- out the day at home or work (i.e., daily routine activity): sitting, sitting and walking, standing or walking but not lifting or carrying things, carrying light loads or climbing stairs, and carrying heavy loads or doing heavy work.
The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category. A total physi- cal activity score was created by summing the MET-hours per week of low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity reported during each age period. A lifetime phys- ical activity score was created by averaging the total physical activity scores calculated for each age period.
The second questionnaire also requested information on sedentary behavior by asking about the average number of hours per day currently spent watching television or videos, and the average number of hours per day spent sitting. The response options for those items were as follows: none; less than1h;1–2h;3–4h;5–6h;7–8h;and9ormorehours.

There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week. Subjects were also asked to indicate which of the following categories best described their routine through- out the day at home or work (i.e., daily routine activity): sitting, sitting and walking, standing or walking but not lifting or carrying things, carrying light loads or climbing stairs, and carrying heavy loads or doing heavy work.
The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category. A total physi- cal activity score was created by summing the MET-hours per week of low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity reported during each age period. A lifetime phys- ical activity score was created by averaging the total physical activity scores calculated for each age period.

For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category. A total physi- cal activity score was created by summing the MET-hours per week of low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity reported during each age period. A lifetime phys- ical activity score was created by averaging the total physical activity scores calculated for each age period.
The second questionnaire also requested information on sedentary behavior by asking about the average number of hours per day currently spent watching television or videos, and the average number of hours per day spent sitting. The response options for those items were as follows: none; less than1h;1–2h;3–4h;5–6h;7–8h;and9ormorehours.

In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to respondents who did not have self-reported prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer at baseline to collect more detailed information on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Among baseline questionnaire respondents, we excluded 179 duplicate questionnaires, 15,760 individuals whose questionnaires were completed by proxies for the intended respondents, 582 persons who died or moved out of the study area before study entry, and 6 people who withdrew from the study. We also excluded 51,193 persons with a previous cancer diagnosis, 997 persons reporting end-stage renal disease, 5,711 subjects with missing information on physical activity, and 4,021 persons who were statistical outliers on reported energy intake. The same exclusion criteria were applied to persons responding to the second questionnaire.",292069,0,1,1,,,,,TPA,3.668958363,,1071589,colon cancer,incidence,"Histologically confirmed incident colon and rectal cancer cases through 31 December , 2003, were ascertained through probabilistic linkage to the eight state cancer registries serving our cohort and three additional states (AZ, NV, and TX), all of which met the certification requirements defined by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, which are estimated to have 90% case ascertainment within 24 months [42]. For matching purposes, we have virtually complete data on first and last name, address history, gender, and date of birth. All suspected matches underwent a process that rejects those with insufficient degree of similarity to confirm a true match (approximately 4%); uncertain matches underwent final manual review. We conducted a validation study of cancer endpoint ascertainment by linking a subset of our cohort (n = 12,000) to the cancer registries and comparing the data to self-reports and subsequent medical record confirmation of incident cancer in this sub-cohort. We found that approximately 90% of all incident cancers were accurately identified using the registries included in this cohort as the gold standard [42]. We used the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition, to classify incident cases of colon cancer (C180–189). Colon cancers were further subdivided into cancers of the proximal colon (C180–184) and distal colon (C185–187). Participants diagnosed simultaneously with a colon and rectal cancer were included in both colon and rectal cancer analyses.",,"The baseline questionnaire asked participants to provide information about the number of times per week during the last 12 months they engaged in periods of physical activity or sports that lasted at least 20 min and caused increases in breathing or heart rate, or caused them to work up a sweat (i.e., current exercise/sports). There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week. Subjects were also asked to indicate which of the following categories best described their routine through- out the day at home or work (i.e., daily routine activity): sitting, sitting and walking, standing or walking but not lifting or carrying things, carrying light loads or climbing stairs, and carrying heavy loads or doing heavy work.
The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category. A total physi- cal activity score was created by summing the MET-hours per week of low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity reported during each age period. A lifetime phys- ical activity score was created by averaging the total physical activity scores calculated for each age period.
The second questionnaire also requested information on sedentary behavior by asking about the average number of hours per day currently spent watching television or videos, and the average number of hours per day spent sitting. The response options for those items were as follows: none; less than1h;1–2h;3–4h;5–6h;7–8h;and9ormorehours.

91,P,,,NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study,Howard et al.,2008,US,Prospective cohort,"Members of AARP between the ages of 50–71 years old at baseline and residing in one of eight study areas (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, and metropolitan Atlanta and Detroit)","The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study was established in 1995–1996 when 567,169 men and women responded to a mailed baseline questionnaire that requested information on diet, family history of cancer, physical activity, anthropometry, and other lifestyle factors [39]. Respon- dents were members of AARP between the ages of 50–71 years old at baseline and residing in one of eight study areas (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Louisiana, and metropolitan Atlanta and Detroit). In 1996–1997, a second questionnaire was sent to respondents who did not have self-reported prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer at baseline to collect more detailed information on physical activity and sedentary behavior. Among baseline questionnaire respondents, we excluded 179 duplicate questionnaires, 15,760 individuals whose questionnaires were completed by proxies for the intended respondents, 582 persons who died or moved out of the study area before study entry, and 6 people who withdrew from the study. We also excluded 51,193 persons with a previous cancer diagnosis, 997 persons reporting end-stage renal disease, 5,711 subjects with missing information on physical activity, and 4,021 persons who were statistical outliers on reported energy intake. The same exclusion criteria were applied to persons responding to the second questionnaire.",196651,0,0,2,,,,,TPA,4.124281087,,811044,colon cancer,incidence,"Histologically confirmed incident colon and rectal cancer cases through 31 December , 2003, were ascertained through probabilistic linkage to the eight state cancer registries serving our cohort and three additional states (AZ, NV, and TX), all of which met the certification requirements defined by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, which are estimated to have 90% case ascertainment within 24 months [42]. For matching purposes, we have virtually complete data on first and last name, address history, gender, and date of birth. All suspected matches underwent a process that rejects those with insufficient degree of similarity to confirm a true match (approximately 4%); uncertain matches underwent final manual review. We conducted a validation study of cancer endpoint ascertainment by linking a subset of our cohort (n = 12,000) to the cancer registries and comparing the data to self-reports and subsequent medical record confirmation of incident cancer in this sub-cohort. We found that approximately 90% of all incident cancers were accurately identified using the registries included in this cohort as the gold standard [42]. We used the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition, to classify incident cases of colon cancer (C180–189). Colon cancers were further subdivided into cancers of the proximal colon (C180–184) and distal colon (C185–187). Participants diagnosed simultaneously with a colon and rectal cancer were included in both colon and rectal cancer analyses.",,"The baseline questionnaire asked participants to provide information about the number of times per week during the last 12 months they engaged in periods of physical activity or sports that lasted at least 20 min and caused increases in breathing or heart rate, or caused them to work up a sweat (i.e., current exercise/sports). There were six possible response options: never; rarely; 1–3 times per month; 1–2 times per week; 3–4 times per week; and 5 or more times per week. Subjects were also asked to indicate which of the following categories best described their routine through- out the day at home or work (i.e., daily routine activity): sitting, sitting and walking, standing or walking but not lifting or carrying things, carrying light loads or climbing stairs, and carrying heavy loads or doing heavy work.
The second questionnaire inquired about physical activity during different ages (15–18 years, 19–29 years, 35–39 years, and in the past 10 years). For each age period, subjects were asked to report the average number of hours per week spent at low intensity activities (e.g., slow walking, bowling, light calisthenics, light gardening, light housework) and at moderate to vigorous activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, aerobics, heavy gardening, heavy housework). Response options for each of those items were as follows: never; rarely; weekly, but less than 1 h per week; 1–3 h per week; 4–7 h per week; and more than 7 h per week. A median value for the number of hours per week of physical activity was assigned and multiplied by the estimated metabolic equivalent task (MET) value spe- cific to that intensity level. One MET is defined as the energy expended while sitting quietly and is approximately equal to 3.5 ml of oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight per minute for a 70-kg adult [40]. The estimated MET values used for the two intensity categories (low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity) were created by averaging individual MET values from all specific activities included in that category. A total physi- cal activity score was created by summing the MET-hours per week of low intensity activity and moderate to vigorous activity reported during each age period. A lifetime phys- ical activity score was created by averaging the total physical activity scores calculated for each age period.
The second questionnaire also requested information on sedentary behavior by asking about the average number of hours per day currently spent watching television or videos, and the average number of hours per day spent sitting.

(defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction or death due to coronary
disease) that occurred after the return of the 1986 questionnaire
and before June 1994. We requested permission to review
the medical records of women who reported a nonfatal myocardial
infarction on a follow-up questionnaire. Study physicians who
had no knowledge of the women’s self-reported risk factors reviewed
the records. Nonfatal myocardial infarction was confirmed
if data in the medical records met World Health Organization criteria
for this condition — namely, symptoms and either diagnostic
electrocardiographic changes or elevated cardiac-enzyme levels.
10
Myocardial infarctions that required hospital admission and
for which confirmatory information was obtained by interview or
letter but for which no medical records were available were designated
as probable infarctions (and constituted 17 percent of all
reported nonfatal infarctions). We included all confirmed and
probable cases of infarction in the analyses because the results
were the same whether probable cases were included or excluded. Follow-up information for nonfatal infarction was obtained for
more than 95 percent of the potential person-time of follow-up.
Deaths were reported by family members or the Postal Service
or were ascertained through state registries or the National Death
Index. We estimate that follow-up for deaths was more than 98
percent complete.
11
Fatal coronary disease (codes 410 through
414 of the
International Classification of Diseases, 8th Revision
12
)
was confirmed by review of the hospital or medical autopsy records
or by review of the death certificate if coronary disease was the
stated cause of death and evidence of previous coronary disease
was available. We designated deaths for which coronary disease was
listed as the underlying cause on the death certificate, but for
which no records were available, as due to presumed fatal coronary
disease. These cases constituted 14.7 percent of all fatal coronary
events. We also included sudden deaths (12.3 percent of all
fatal coronary events). Analyses limited to confirmed cases yielded
results similar to those in which confirmed and presumed cases
of fatal coronary disease were combined.",,Questionnaire,MET-h/wk,"Detailed information on physical activity was first collected in
1986 and was updated in 1988 and 1992. Participants were asked
to report the average amount of time spent per week during the
previous year in walking or hiking outdoors (including walking
to work or while playing golf ), jogging (at a speed slower than
10 minutes per mile [6 minutes per kilometer]), running (at 10
minutes per mile or faster), bicycling (including the use of a stationary
bicycle), swimming laps, playing tennis or squash, or participating
in calisthenics, aerobics, or aerobic dance; in addition,
the women were asked to report the average number of flights of
stairs they climbed each week. Women also reported their usual
walking pace: easy or casual (<2.0 miles per hour [mph] [3.2 km
per hour]), average (2.0 to 2.9 mph [3.2 to 4.6 km per hour]),
brisk (3.0 to 3.9 mph [4.8 to 6.2 km per hour]), or very brisk
(»4.0 mph [6.4 km per hour]). Using a standardized classification
of the energy costs of physical activities,
8
we calculated a
weekly metabolic-equivalent (MET) score for total physical activity,
vigorous activity (»6 MET per hour), nonvigorous activity
(<6 MET per hour), and walking (2.5 to 4.5 MET per hour, depending
on the pace). One MET is the caloric need per kilogram
of body weight per hour of activity, divided by the caloric need
per kilogram per hour at rest. Physical-activity scores were expressed
as MET-hours per week. Validation of the questionnaire
for assessing physical activity has been described previously in a
similar cohort
9
; the overall correlation between physical activities
reported on the questionnaire and those recorded in four oneweek
diaries was 0.62, and the correlation was 0.79 for activities
reported on the questionnaire and those recalled after one week.
9
For secondary analyses, we used data from a shorter questionnaire
about physical activity that was administered in 1980 and
1982. On the 1980 questionnaire, women were asked to report
the average number of hours they spent each week during the
previous year engaged in moderate or vigorous recreational activities,
including vigorous sports, jogging, bicycling, brisk walking,
heavy gardening, or heavy housework. On the 1982 questionnaire,
women were asked the question: “For how many hours per
week, on average, do you engage in activity strenuous enough to
build up a sweat?” To analyze this information, we calculated the
cumulative average number of hours per week spent in moderate
or vigorous recreational activities (all the activities listed above except
for walking at a casual or average pace), as assessed in 1980,
and (with updated information) in 1982, 1986, 1988, and 1992.",,645,rr,Age adjusted,"The model included variables for age (in five-year categories), period during the study (four two-year periods), smoking status (never

women were asked the question: “For how many hours per
week on average do you engage in activity strenuous enough to
build up a sweat?” To analyze this information we calculated the
cumulative average number of hours per week spent in moderate

were asked the average amount of time
they spent per week doing each of the
following physical activities: walking,
jogging, running, bicycling, calisthenics/
aerobics/aerobic dance/rowing
machine, lap swimming, squash/
racquetball, and tennis. They were also
asked about their usual walking pace,
specified as easy (,2.0 mph), moderate
(2.0-2.9 mph), brisk (3.0-3.9 mph),
or very brisk ($4 mph). From this
information, energy expenditure in
metabolic equivalent tasks (METs),
measured in hours per week, was calculated.
17 Because only 2% of the subjects
reported very brisk pace, we combined
the brisk and very brisk categories
in the analyses of walking pace and
stroke risk.Wedefined any physical activity
requiring 6 METs or more ($6-
fold increase from resting metabolic
rate) as vigorous. These activities included
jogging, running, bicycling,
calisthenics/aerobic/aerobic dance/
rowing machine, lap swimming,
squash/racquetball, and tennis. In contrast,
walking requires an energy
expenditure of only 2.0 to 4.5 METs,
depending on pace; we therefore considered
it to be a moderate-intensity
activity.
On the 1980 questionnaire, women
were asked to report the average number
of hours they spent each week during
the past year on moderate and vigorous
recreational activities, such as
heavy gardening, vigorous sports, jogging,
brisk/very brisk walking, bicycling,
and heavy housework. On the
1982 questionnaire, women were asked
a slightly different question: “For how
many hours per week, on average, do
you engage in activity strenuous enough
to build up a sweat?” To use this information,
we created a variable representing
average hours per week spent
doing moderate or vigorous recreational
activities (all activities described
heretofore except for hours
spent walking at an easy or normal
pace) across 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988,

We further divided the moderate category into those who engaged in moderate activity less than 2 times a week or 2 or more times per week.

In the NHS, we were unable to derive MET-hours comparable to the men until the 1986 questionnaire. Thus, to keep the fol- low-up period consistent for men and women and to use all cases that arose in the follow-up period, we used the responses on the 1980 questionnaire to classify participants into 5 physical activity categories. More specifically, in 1980 the nurses reported whether they engaged in exercise intensely enough to produce sweating and then the intensity of the specific activity that they reported engag- ing in most frequently. Women who reported never sweating were classified as low activity (the reference group). Women were considered to have moderate physical activity if they reported sweating and engaged in a moderately intense activity (i.e., a metabolic equivalent score between 1 and 4). Participants who reported sweating and engaged in vigorous activity (MET score of 4 or more) were categorized as high activity. We further divided the moderate category into those who engaged in moderate activity less than 2 times a week or 2 or more times per week. The high activity category was also further divided into those who reported 4 to 6 METS and those with more than 6 METS. Thus, we had 5 categories based on a combination of sweating or not, and MET scores for their primary physical activity. A similar derivation of physical activity in this cohort has been published previously.23 Starting in 1986, we were able to directly calculate a MET hours per week for each NHS participant.

Women who reported never sweating were classified as low activity (the reference group). Women were considered to have moderate physical activity if they reported sweating and engaged in a moderately intense activity (i.e., a metabolic equivalent score between 1 and 4). Participants who reported sweating and engaged in vigorous activity (MET score of 4 or more) were categorized as high activity. We further divided the moderate category into those who engaged in moderate activity less than 2 times a week or 2 or more times per week. The high activity category was also further divided into those who reported 4 to 6 METS and those with more than 6 METS.

Biennially thereafter, participants received follow-up questionnaires to update information on lifestyle factors, including endometrial cancer risk factors, and new disease diagnoses. The response rate in the initial invitation cycle was 71%, and response rates of approximately 90% have been achieved in each follow-up cycle. At the start of follow-up in 1986, when detailed physical activity was first assessed, we excluded nurses who had died or reported previous cancers except non-melanoma skin can- cer (N510,174), reported a hysterectomy or surgical meno- pause (N531,666), or were missing all activity data during follow-up (N 5 8,290). At each subsequent follow-up cycle, we censored deaths or cancer diagnoses as well as women reporting hysterectomy or surgical menopause.",71570,1,0,2,,,,,LTPA,14.10518374,,1009508,endometrial cancer,incidence,"Information on endometrial cancer was collected from ques- tionnaires at each follow-up cycle. To confirm cancer diagno- ses, study physicians masked to exposure status reviewed medical records after obtaining permission from participants. Data were collected on histological type, presence of invasion and stage as well as grade. In this analysis, we included cases of invasive endometrial adenocarcinoma (ICD-O histology code 8380/3) because of potential heterogeneity by histologi- cal subtype. Cases were defined by the 1988 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria as stage IA to IVB diagnosed from 1986 to May 2008 and con- firmed by medical records (99% of reported cases confirmed). Women diagnosed with non-epithelial tumors (N5129), types of epithelial tumors other than adenocarcinoma (e.g., squamous cell) (N 5 127) or non-invasive tumors (endome- trial intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical hyperplasia or adeno- carcinoma in situ) (N 5 288) were censored during follow- up.",,"Detailed information on recreational physical activity during the past year was assessed by questionnaire in 1986. Partici- pants reported their average weekly time spent on any of eight activities: walking or hiking, jogging, running, bicycling, lap swimming, playing tennis, calisthenics/aerobics/aerobic dance/rowing machine and playing squash or racquetball. Participants also reported their usual walking pace and the number of flights of stairs climbed daily. These questions were repeated, with minor changes, every 2–4 years (1988, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2004). Starting in 1992, information was collected on other lower intensity (e.g., yoga, stretching and toning) and vigorous (e.g., lawn mowing) activities. Starting in 1990, participants were asked whether their health limited them in performing typical activities (e.g., walking 1 block, moderate activities and vigorous activities). Physical activity data were carried forward when activity was not included on the biennial questionnaires (e.g., 1988 data used in the 1990–1992 follow-up). However, activity data were not carried forward when women failed to answer phys- ical activity questions (e.g., 1992 data were not carried for- ward if a woman was missing 1994 data).
To incorporate activity frequency, duration and intensity, we calculated total metabolic equivalent (MET) hours of activity per week (MET-hr/week).20,21 During each question- naire cycle, participants with unreasonably high levels of activity (1251 MET-hr/week, or approximately 6 hr per day of average recreational walking) were assigned missing activ- ity values. In analyses of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activities, we defined a priori only brisk or very brisk walk- ing, jogging or running as moderate or vigorous activity.

The reproducibility and validity of these questions have been described previously.23 In a similar population of NHS II participants (N 5 151), the correlation over a 1-year period between activity reported by questionnaire and that assessed by past-week recalls was 0.79, and the correlation between moderate or vigorous activity reported by questionnaire and that assessed by activity diaries was 0.62.",MET-hr/week,We categorized total recreational activity into multiples of 3 as 3 METs represents 1 hr of average walking.,Moderate or vigorous-intensity activity ,,rr,"Adjusted for age at menarche (7–12, >12–13, >13–18, missing years), OC use (never, <1, 1 to <3, 3 to <6, ??6, missing years), parity and age at first birth (nulliparous, 1–2 children <25 years, 1–2 children 25–29 years, 1–2 children ??30 years, 3–4 children <25 years, 3–4 children 25–29 years, 3–4 children ??30 years, ??5 children <25 years, ??5 children ??25 years, missing), age at last birth (nulliparous, <25, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, ??40, missing years), menopausal status (pre-, post-, dubious or missing), age at menopause (continuous), HT (never, past, current <5 years, cur- rent ??5 years, missing), HT type (never, E only, E1P, other, missing), BMI at age 18 (<19, 19 to <21, 21 to <23, ??23, missing kg/m2), pack-years of smoking (0, 0 to <20, 20 to <40, ??40, missing), family history of endometrial cancer (yes, no), family history of colorectal cancer (yes, no), alco- hol intake (none, <5, 5 to <15, ??15, missing g/day) and caffeine intake (quartiles, missing) and recent BMI (continuous).","Adjusted for age at menarche (7–12, >12–13, >13–18, missing years), OC use (never, <1, 1 to <3, 3 to <6, ??6, missing years), parity and age at first birth (nulliparous, 1–2 children <25 years, 1–2 children 25–29 years, 1–2 children ??30 years, 3–4 children <25 years, 3–4 children 25–29 years, 3–4 children ??30 years, ??5 children <25 years, ??5 children ??25 years, missing), age at last birth (nulliparous, <25, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, ??40, missing years), menopausal status (pre-, post-, dubious or missing), age at menopause (continuous), HT (never, past, current <5 years, cur- rent ??5 years, missing), HT type (never, E only, E1P, other, missing), BMI at age 18 (<19, 19 to <21, 21 to <23, ??23, missing kg/m2), pack-years of smoking (0, 0 to <20, 20 to <40, ??40, missing), family history of endometrial cancer (yes, no), family history of colorectal cancer (yes, no), alco- hol intake (none, <5, 5 to <15, ??15, missing g/day) and caffeine intake (quartiles, missing).",NA,9-<18,98,148550,,0.78,0.59,1.03,0.78,0.59,1.03,,,,PA assessment is culumative average,,,,4.45,5.06,18.05,,,,,4.45,18-<27 MET-h/wk [midpoint: 22.5],,22.50,,18.05,,,,,,,4.45,5.06,22.50,,18.05,,18.05,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,P,,,Nurses’ Health Study,Du et al.,2014,US,Prospective cohort,United States nurses aged 30 to 55y.,"The NHS prospective cohort was established in 1976, when 121,700 female registered nurses residing in 11 US states and aged 30–55 years provided detailed information on individual characteristics and behaviors in mailed questionnaires admin- istered at baseline. Biennially thereafter, participants received follow-up questionnaires to update information on lifestyle factors, including endometrial cancer risk factors, and new disease diagnoses. The response rate in the initial invitation cycle was 71%, and response rates of approximately 90% have been achieved in each follow-up cycle. At the start of follow-up in 1986, when detailed physical activity was first assessed, we excluded nurses who had died or reported previous cancers except non-melanoma skin can- cer (N510,174), reported a hysterectomy or surgical meno- pause (N531,666), or were missing all activity data during follow-up (N 5 8,290). At each subsequent follow-up cycle, we censored deaths or cancer diagnoses as well as women reporting hysterectomy or surgical menopause.",71570,1,0,2,,,,,LTPA,14.10518374,,1009508,endometrial cancer,incidence,"Information on endometrial cancer was collected from ques- tionnaires at each follow-up cycle. To confirm cancer diagno- ses, study physicians masked to exposure status reviewed medical records after obtaining permission from participants. Data were collected on histological type, presence of invasion and stage as well as grade. In this analysis, we included cases of invasive endometrial adenocarcinoma (ICD-O histology code 8380/3) because of potential heterogeneity by histologi- cal subtype. Cases were defined by the 1988 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria as stage IA to IVB diagnosed from 1986 to May 2008 and con- firmed by medical records (99% of reported cases confirmed). Women diagnosed with non-epithelial tumors (N5129), types of epithelial tumors other than adenocarcinoma (e.g., squamous cell) (N 5 127) or non-invasive tumors (endome- trial intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical hyperplasia or adeno- carcinoma in situ) (N 5 288) were censored during follow- up.",,"Detailed information on recreational physical activity during the past year was assessed by questionnaire in 1986. Partici- pants reported their average weekly time spent on any of eight activities: walking or hiking, jogging, running, bicycling, lap swimming, playing tennis, calisthenics/aerobics/aerobic dance/rowing machine and playing squash or racquetball. Participants also reported their usual walking pace and the number of flights of stairs climbed daily. These questions were repeated, with minor changes, every 2–4 years (1988, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2004). Starting in 1992, information was collected on other lower intensity (e.g., yoga, stretching and toning) and vigorous (e.g., lawn mowing) activities. Starting in 1990, participants were asked whether their health limited them in performing typical activities (e.g., walking 1 block, moderate activities and vigorous activities). Physical activity data were carried forward when activity was not included on the biennial questionnaires (e.g., 1988 data used in the 1990–1992 follow-up). However, activity data were not carried forward when women failed to answer phys- ical activity questions (e.g., 1992 data were not carried for- ward if a woman was missing 1994 data).
To incorporate activity frequency, duration and intensity, we calculated total metabolic equivalent (MET) hours of activity per week (MET-hr/week).20,21 During each question- naire cycle, participants with unreasonably high levels of activity (1251 MET-hr/week, or approximately 6 hr per day of average recreational walking) were assigned missing activ- ity values. In analyses of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activities, we defined a priori only brisk or very brisk walk- ing, jogging or running as moderate or vigorous activity. Because of the variable intensity with which activities such as swimming and biking may be performed, excluding these activities may reduce potential misclassification of moderate or vigorous activity.18 In analyses of walking and walking pace, however, we were interested specifically in whether walking was beneficial even if women did not perform any vigorous activities. We thus used a more general definition of vigorous activities, which included any activities that were potentially vigorous (6 METs or greater: jogging, running, bicycling, swimming, tennis, calisthenics/aerobics, racquet sports and other vigorous activity) in analyses of walking.22 We categorized total recreational activity into multiples of 3 as 3 METs represents 1 hr of average walking.20 Moderate or vigorous activity was categorized by hours per week for increased comparability to existing physical activity guidelines.22 For adequate statistical power to examine high levels of activity, we selected category cut points that resulted in an approximately even distribution of cases in higher activity categories.

cohort study that was established in 1976
when 121701 female registered nurses aged
30 to 55 years returned a mailed questionnaire
about their medical histories and lifestyles","Because physical activity questions were
first asked in the 1980 questionnaire, our baseline
cohort consisted of the women who returned
the 1980 questionnaire and answered
the physical activity questions (n=85326). We
excluded women at baseline with a history of
cardiovascular disease or cancer (n=4978); as
a result, 80348 women were included in analyses
that began in 1980",80348,1,0,2,46.3,,,,LTPA,14,,1270498,all-cause mortality,mortality,"The primary endpoint in this analysiswas death

activity on the 1980 questionnaire. We used a
single question about the average number of
hours spent each week during the previous year
on such activities as heavy gardening, vigorous
sports, jogging, walking or striding, bicycling,
or heavy housework. On the 1982 questionnaire women were asked a slightly different
question: “For how many hours per week, on
average, do you engage in activity strenuous
enough to build up a sweat?”
In 1986, 1988, and 1992, the physical activity
questions were more detailed (there were
no physical activity questions on the 1990 survey);
women were asked to report the average
time spent per week during the previous year
on each of the following activities: walking or
hiking outdoors, jogging (slower than 10 minutes
per mile), running (10 minutes per mile
or faster), bicycling (including use of a stationary
bicycle), swimming, playing tennis or
squash, and participating in calisthenics, aerobics,
or aerobic dance or using a rowing machine.
Each woman also reported her usual
walking pace: easy (less than 2 miles [3.2 km]
per hour), normal (2–2.9 miles per hour), brisk
(3–3.9 miles per hour), or very brisk (4 miles
per hour or faster). Thus, for 1980, 1982, 1986,
1988, and 1992, we had a measure of average
hours per week of physical activity. For 1986,
1988, and 1992, we also created variables representing
average hours per week of walking

participants with a recent self-reported diagnosis of HF. Of these 100
participants, 8 had previously requested that they not be contacted
for additional information, and 4 had died. The remaining 88
participants were mailed a questionnaire to collect information on
symptoms, signs, and laboratory investigations at the time of first
diagnosis of HF and a list of current medications for the treatment of
HF. After 2 mailings followed by telephone contact, we collected
and reviewed data from 76 of 88 (86%) to verify the diagnosis of HF.
Among these 76 responders, 68 (89%) were on current treatment for
HF and/or met the Framingham Heart Study criteria for HF at the

The next question asked the average amount of time spent (minutes per exercise) exercising and what physical activity (of 9 options) was frequently done during the week. Each activity on the questionnaire was assigned a MET value,21 which was calculated based on the energy expended by sitting quietly.

Participants were first asked whether they participated in any form of exercise on a weekly basis. Regular exercise was defined as engaging in leisure-time exercise of any type and intensity at least once per week. Men who exercised regularly were further asked to list the 3 exercises in which they most frequently engaged and then were asked questions about the average amount of time spent per week on each exercise and the number of years of participation. In addition to exercise participation, information was also obtained from all participants on other forms of physical activity, including household-, transportation-, and occupation-related physical activity. To assess exercise intensity, a standard metabolic equivalent (MET) score was assigned to each exercise according to pre- viously established criteria (walking, 3.3 METs; Tai Chi, 4.0 METs; jogging, 7.0 METs, etc.) (23). We calculated MET- hours per day for each type of exercise and each other form of physical activity by multiplying the MET score by time spent on the activity. The total MET-hours per day were then estimated by summing the MET-hours per day for each activity.
The reproducibility and validity of the physical activity questionnaire used in the SMHS were evaluated in a random sample of 196 participants and found to be reasonably high (24).

With LTPA volume being the product of intensity (MET) and duration of exercise (h) the calculated MET-h per week of each individual was placed into one of the five categories: inactive (<3·75 MET-h) low (3·75–7·49 MET-h) medium (7·50–16·49 MET-h) high (16·50–25·49 MET-h) or very high (?25·50 MET-h) in accordance with classifications in the 2008 physical activity guidelines for Americans.1 In each LTPA category we also classified each participant by exercise intensity into one of two groups: moderate intensity exercise or vigorous-intensity exercise. The moderate-intensity category consisted of individuals who did no vigorous-intensity exercise by excluding those who indicated that they did no medium-vigorous or high-vigorous exercise. All other individuals were put in the vigorous-intensity group. The third question was about the amount of physical activity done at work classifying individuals into one of four different activity levels from a low level of mainly sedentary work to a high level of hard physical labour.,459,,226493,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1.00,1.88,0.88,Paper reported mean volume and duration.

With LTPA volume being the product of intensity (MET) and duration of exercise (h), the calculated MET-h per week of each individual was placed into one of the five categories: inactive (<3·75 MET-h), low (3·75–7·49 MET-h), medium (7·50–16·49 MET-h), high (16·50–25·49 MET-h), or very high (?25·50 MET-h), in accordance with classifications in the 2008 physical activity guidelines for Americans.1 In each LTPA category, we also classified each participant by exercise intensity into one of two groups: moderate intensity exercise or vigorous-intensity exercise. The moderate-intensity category consisted of individuals who did no vigorous-intensity exercise, by excluding those who indicated that they did no medium-vigorous or high-vigorous exercise. All other individuals were put in the vigorous-intensity group. The third question was about the amount of physical activity done at work, classifying individuals into one of four different activity levels, from a low level of mainly sedentary work to a high level of hard physical labour.",,,hr,"pre-specifi ed confounders were age, sex,

death from coronary causes, coronary revascularization, angina,
congestive heart failure, stroke, or carotid revascularization) that

of nonfatal myocardial infarction was confirmed if data in
the hospital record met standardized criteria of diagnostic electrocardiographic
changes, elevated cardiac-enzyme levels, or both.

Treatment with coronary or carotid revascularization was confirmed
by documentation of the procedure in the medical record. The presence
of angina was confirmed by hospitalization and confirmatory
evidence on angiography, diagnostic stress test, or diagnosis by a
physician and medical treatment. The occurrence of stroke was confirmed
by documentation in the medical record of the rapid onset
of a neurologic deficit consistent with stroke and lasting at least 24
hours or until death. The presence of congestive heart failure was
confirmed by hospitalization and diagnostic confirmatory tests.
Fatal coronary disease was considered confirmed if there was documentation

was listed as the cause of death on the death certificate and evidence

height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, and blood

Recreational physical activity was assessed by a detailed questionnaire

by a series of questions about the frequency of walks outside
the home for more than 10 minutes without stopping, the average
duration of each walk, and the usual walking pace. Vigorous
exercise was defined as that in which “you work up a sweat and your
heart beats fast,” and examples included aerobics, aerobic dancing,
jogging, tennis, and swimming laps. Moderate exercise was defined
as that which was “not exhausting,” and examples included biking
outdoors, using an exercise machine (such as a stationary bicycle or
a treadmill), calisthenics, easy swimming, and popular or folk dancing.
Examples of mild exercise were slow dancing, bowling, and
golf. Using a standardized classification of the energy expenditure
associated with physical activities,

In addition, we asked for the usual pace of walking and the number of  ?ights of stairs climbed daily. Based on the rate of energy expenditure required by these activities, we assigned a multiple of resting metabolic rate (MET score) to each group of activities and stair climbing [26]. Since resting metabolic rate is approximately 4.2 kJ/kg body weight per hour, we calculated the energy expended per week on each group of activities and stair climbing by multiplying the assigned MET score by 4.2, body weight and hours per week of participa- tion [27]. (We assumed a rate of 70 steps per minute to estimate the time spent in climbing stairs [28].) We then summed kilojoules per week from the eight groups of activities, plus stair climbing, to estimate the weekly energy expenditure on recreational activities for each woman.

Based on the rate of energy expenditure required by these activities, we assigned a multiple of resting metabolic rate (MET score) to each group of activities and stair climbing [26]. Since resting metabolic rate is approximately 4.2 kJ/kg body weight per hour, we calculated the energy expended per week on each group of activities and stair climbing by multiplying the assigned MET score by 4.2, body weight and hours per week of participa- tion [27]. (We assumed a rate of 70 steps per minute to estimate the time spent in climbing stairs [28].) We then summed kilojoules per week from the eight groups of activities, plus stair climbing, to estimate the weekly energy expenditure on recreational activities for each woman.

asked for permission to review their medical records. A diagnosis of
stroke was confirmed only after medical record review by an End
Points Committee of physicians that included a neurologist. A
nonfatal stroke was defined as a focal neurological deficit of sudden
onset and vascular mechanism that lasted  24 hours. Cases of fatal
stroke were documented by evidence of a cerebrovascular mechanism
obtained from available sources, including death certificates
and hospital records. Stroke was classified according to the National
Survey of Stroke criteria22 as ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or
unknown subtype. The interobserver agreement of the classification
of stroke and its major subtypes was excellent.23",,"On the baseline survey, women were asked to estimate the average

1.5 hour/week, 2 to 3 hour/week, 4 to 6 hour/week, or  7

past year: walking or hiking; jogging (slower than 10-minute miles);
running (10-minute miles or faster); bicycling, including use of
stationary machines; aerobic exercise, aerobic dance, use of exercise
machines; tennis, squash, or racquetball; lap swimming, and lowerintensity
exercise, including yoga, stretching, or toning. They also
reported their usual walking pace (do not walk regularly,  3.2
km/hour [2 mph; casual pace], 3.2 to 4.7 km/hour [2 to 2.9 mph;
normal, average pace], 4.8 to 6.3 km/hour [3.0 to 3.9 mph; brisk
pace], or  6.4 km/hour [4.0 mph; very brisk/striding pace]) and the
number of flights of stairs climbed daily (0, 1 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 9, 10

months); and cycle 2 of observational follow-up (24 months after
trial conclusion). We refer to these times as the 36-, 72-, 96-, 125-,

We assigned a multiple of resting metabolic rate (metabolic
equivalent score) to each group of activities and stair climbing based
on their energy costs17 and estimated the energy expended on each of
these activities.18 This assessment of physical activity has been
shown to be reliable and valid.19 We summed kilocalories per week
from the 8 groups of recreational activities and stair climbing to
estimate weekly energy expenditure and categorized women into
approximate quartiles of energy expenditure:  200, 200 to 599, 600
to 1499, or  1500 kcal/week, for analyses of physical activity. We
also conducted additional analyses with energy expenditure estimated
